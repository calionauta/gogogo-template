#     compose/docker-compose.prod.yml   (replaced on every deploy)
#     env/.env                  (committed to repo, no secrets)
#     secrets/gogogo-fullstack-template.env  (mode 600, regenerated every deploy
#                                   from GH Secrets; never committed)
#     data/pb_data/             (gitignored, persistent volume)

# We use /home/deploy/ (not /opt/) because the deploy user does not
# have passwordless sudo; /opt is root-owned. /home/deploy is writable
# by the deploy user and Docker still reads the compose file + binds
# the volume from there.
#
# This script is the second half of the deploy: the GH Action does
# the build + scp; this script restarts the container. We split it
# so the operator can also run it manually (e.g. for fast rollback
# to the previous binary which is kept as `gogogo-fullstack-template.previous`).

#   2. Prefer an ACL granting uid 65532 rwx (no other users affected),
#      applied RECURSIVELY (-R) with a DEFAULT acl (-d) so subdirs the
#      app or the calling workflow pre-create (e.g. data/pb_data) also
#      grant uid 65532 rwx. Without this the container (running as
#      65532) cannot write its SQLite WAL files and crashes with
#      permission denied.
#   3. Fall back to world-writable (chmod -R 0777) if setfacl is absent.
