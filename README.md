</p>

A starting point for web projects in Go. Single binary, zero external services, LLM-friendly.

We built this template to resolve those choices up front, without locking you into a closed ecosystem.

> **One binary, one process, one image.** ~30 MB, no shell, no libc, no CDN.
> Runs on `scratch` (or `gcr.io/distroless/static-debian12:nonroot` if you need a debug base). All CSS is compiled at build time via Tailwind v4 + DaisyUI v5 and embedded via `//go:embed` — no JS runtime.

> **Made with intent to be useful, not to be right.** We optimize for shipping something that runs today over being philosophically correct. Decisions here are pragmatic, not dogmatic.

Every web project we start begins with the same conversation: pick a database, auth, router, reactive UI framework, task queue… and the project stalls at the decisions, installations, and configurations — not the code.

## Who this template is for

- **You who get tired of configuring the same stack over and over**
- **You who want a single binary for deploy, with no Redis, Postgres, or SaaS**
- **You who want an LLM client wired in without pulling in a whole orchestration framework** — `internal/llm` wraps GoAI (any OpenAI-compatible provider) behind an injectable interface, callable from handlers. It calls a *remote* provider API; it is **not** a local-model runtime.
- **You who prefer server-rendered HTML over 2MB SPAs**

It's not a framework. There's no lock-in. Each piece can be replaced individually.

## What's in the package

Everything you need to build a modern web app, in a single binary:

| Layer | Choice | Why |
|-------|--------|-----|
| **Language** | Go 1.26 | Fast compilation, easy deploy, lean runtime |
| **Database + Auth + API** | [PocketBase](https://pocketbase.io) (embedded, on `ncruces/go-sqlite3`) | Zero-config auth, REST, [admin UI at `/_/`](https://<your-domain>/_/), file storage — all in SQLite |
| **Templating** | [Templ](https://templ.guide) | Type-safe Go components, generated at build time |
| **Reactive UI** | [Datastar](https://data-star.dev) (SSE) | Server-rendered over SSE, single ~12 KiB client. CSS built once via Tailwind v4 CLI; no JS runtime. |
| **CSS** | [DaisyUI v5](https://daisyui.com) + TailwindCSS | Ready components, customizable, ~34kB minified |
| **Task queue** | [goqite](https://github.com/maragudk/goqite) + SSE Hub | Background jobs streamed to the browser, no Redis |
| **Retries** | [avast/retry-go v4](https://github.com/avast/retry-go) | Exponential backoff with jitter, no boilerplate |
| **Workflows** | [DagNats](https://github.com/danmestas/dagnats) | Multi-step durable workflows as declarative JSON over NATS JetStream (build-tag gated) |
| **LLM SDK** | [GoAI](https://github.com/zendev-sh/goai) | Any provider: OpenAI, Anthropic, Groq, Ollama… |
| **Real-time** | [NATS JetStream](https://nats.io) (opt-in) | Multi-user real-time, only enabled when you need it |
| **Secrets** | [age](https://age-encryption.org) + `~/.secrets/` | Local encryption, no vault, no cloud |
| **IDs** | [google/uuid](https://github.com/google/uuid) | Stable request/job IDs |
| **Live reload** | [Air](https://github.com/air-verse/air) | `make dev` regenerates templ and restarts the binary |
| **CRDT (collaborative docs)** | [loro-go](https://github.com/aholstenson/loro-go) | Conflict-free merging of whiteboard/notes state; converges offline edits with no LWW data loss |
| **Hand-drawn canvas** | [Rough.js](https://roughjs.com) (CDN) | Minimalist sketchy whiteboard rendering, loaded from jsDelivr — no build dependency |
| **Linting** | [golangci-lint](https://golangci-lint.run) + [datastar-lint](https://github.com/calionauta/datastar-lint) | `errcheck`, `staticcheck`, `gosec`, `revive`, `gocritic` (see `.golangci.yml`); `datastar-lint` catches Datastar attribute/signal/expression mistakes (run via `make datastar-lint`) |
| **CI/CD** | GitHub Actions | `ci.yml` (lint + test + build, tag matrix `""`/`jetstream`/`dagnats`) + `deploy.yml` (multi-arch Docker to ghcr.io, runs on `master`) |

> **Why `ncruces/go-sqlite3`?** It's the pure-Go (no cgo) SQLite build that bundles the extensions this template leans on — FTS5, `spellfix1`, `unicode` collations — which the stock driver leaves out. That's why the `//go:build`/driver init in `db/pocketbase.go` pins it instead of `modernc.org/sqlite` directly.

## Stack in layers, not silos

Most templates force you to pick one async strategy — usually a queue, sometimes a workflow runtime, rarely both. Real apps need **a queue for background jobs**, **a workflow runtime for durable multi-step processes**, and **a real-time layer for cross-client state** — each solving a different problem. We ship all three as build-tagged layers so you only pay for what you use.

We solve this with **three complementary async layers**:

```
goqite    → background jobs + SSE to the browser (default, always on)
dagnats   → durable multi-step workflows as JSON (opt-in, build tag)
JetStream → multi-user real-time (opt-in, build tag)
```

They coexist in the same binary. They don't compete.

The `goqite` queue is the **only async layer with a build tag off** — it's core and always on. DagNats and JetStream are opt-in heavyweight features: enable them when you actually need durable multi-step workflows or multi-instance realtime. The default build (`go build ./cmd/web`) is the recommended starting point for almost every project.

## Feature matrix: from Lean to Full

Every opt-in capability is gated by a **build tag + a runtime env flag**, with a noop stub compiled in by default so the core binary stays small and fast. Mix and match — the tags are additive and share a single embedded NATS when combined.

| Capability | Build tag | Env opt-out | What you get | Default? |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|--------------|----------|
| **Todo app + SSE Hub** | — | — | Single-instance real-time via in-process `SSEHub`; cross-client mutations broadcast with exclude-origin | ✅ always on |
| **Queue + retry** | — | — | `goqite` background jobs + `retry-go` (the "Queue + Retry" demo) | ✅ always on |
| **AI Suggest** | — | `GOAI_API_KEY` unset | GoAI/Groq call from the todo UI; button hidden when no key | ✅ on, auto-hidden |
| **Collaborative whiteboard** | — | — | Loro CRDT + Rough.js canvas, SSE broadcast, offline-first outbox replay, PocketBase-persisted snapshots | ✅ always on (web path) |
| **Multi-user real-time** | `jetstream` | `NATS_ENABLED=false` | Durable `JetStream` stream for cross-instance todo broadcast (browser still uses SSE; JetStream is the server-side fan-out) | ❌ opt-in |
| **Durable workflows** | `dagnats` | `DAGNATS_ENABLED=false` | DagNats JSON workflows over JetStream on `:8090` (e.g. `WelcomeOnboarding`) | ❌ opt-in |
| **Desktop-edge whiteboard sync** | `jetstream` | `NATS_ENABLED=false` | Leaf-Node JetStream replication of Loro updates for desktop/edge clients | ❌ opt-in |

**Recommended mixes**

| Profile | Tags | Use when |
|---------|------|-----------|
| **Lean** | _(none)_ | Single-instance web app: todos, queue+retry, AI suggest, whiteboard. `make build` |
| **Realtime** | `-tags jetstream` | You run >1 instance behind a load balancer and need todos to sync across them. Whiteboard stays SSE (web) |
| **Workflows** | `-tags dagnats` | You need durable multi-step processes that survive restarts |
| **Full** | `-tags "jetstream dagnats"` | Production: both realtime + workflows, sharing one embedded NATS on `:4222` (recommended combo) |

> **Build-tag rule for new features.** To add your own optional capability, follow the existing shape: `internal/feature/<name>.go` (real impl) + `internal/feature/<name>_noop.go` (default-build stub) + a `cfg.<Name>.Enabled` flag. See `docs/decisions.md`.

## The example: Todo App with SSE

We ship a working Todo App:

- Full CRUD via PocketBase
- Reactive UI with Datastar + DaisyUI
- Real-time SSE streaming. Mutations (`create`/`toggle`/`delete`) publish to `nats.TodoBroadcaster`; default build fans out via the in-process SSE Hub (single-instance), `-tags jetstream` fans out via a durable JetStream stream (multi-instance). Late joiners get a replay buffer; slow clients are dropped, never block the producer.
- Stacked toast notifications (auto-dismiss, manual close, progress bar)
- Async jobs: `handleCreate` enqueues a `todo_created` job; a worker picks it up and streams a success toast to the right browser tab via the SSE Hub (`clientID` routing)
- Retries with exponential backoff and jitter (`internal/queue/retry.go`, retry-go v4) — SSE-aware: a retry emits a `lastRetry` signal so the UI can show "retrying…"
- `WelcomeOnboarding` DagNats workflow (with `-tags dagnats`) that creates 3 example todos via durable steps — kill the server mid-run, restart, watch it resume at the last incomplete step. The workflow is declarative JSON (`internal/dagnats/workflow.go`), so renaming Go handlers never orphans an in-flight run.
- **Admin unlock** via `age` + `~/.secrets/`. The Todo example wires a master-password path: when `ADMIN_UNLOCK_TOKEN` is set (in the age-encrypted secrets file), the UI shows a "Clear all" form; the handler compares constant-time and clears all todos on match. Demonstrates the age flow end-to-end.
- **AI suggest** via GoAI. When `GOAI_API_KEY` is set, the input gets a "Suggest" button that enqueues an async suggest job (see queue below) and streams the 3 completions back via SSE. It talks to whatever OpenAI-compatible provider `GOAI_BASE_URL`/`GOAI_MODEL` point at — see [Configuring the LLM](#configuring-the-llm-goai). Retries with exponential backoff use the same `internal/queue/retry.go` as the SSE toast path. For a **keyless** demo of the exact same queue + retry path, set `SIMULATE_LLM=true`: a "Suggest (simulated)" button enqueues a job that hits an in-process fake LLM scripting 500 → 200 + delay, so you can watch the retry feedback toasts (enqueued → attempt failed → slow → result).
- Tests run with `-race`

> **This is the contract you should imitate when adding a new feature:**
> 1. **Pure HTTP + Datastar** for the user-facing surface.
> 2. **goqite job** for any work that takes more than ~50ms (LLM, email, exports).
> 3. **SSE toast** for async feedback to the originating client via `clientID` routing.
> 4. **age-encrypted secret** if the feature needs a credential.
> Every existing feature (toast on create, AI suggest, admin unlock, DagNats onboarding) follows this exact shape.

Enough to understand the pattern and start your own feature module.

## PocketBase admin UI (built in)

PocketBase ships a full admin UI for free — it runs at **`/_/`** on the same domain. Once deployed, your admin UI lives at `https://<your-domain>/_/`.

What you get out of the box:

- **Visual data browser** for every collection (todos, users, etc.) with sort/filter/CSV export
- **REST + JS SDK playground** for the API endpoints PocketBase generated from your schema
- **Superuser management** (create the first one via the install link printed in the server logs)
- **File storage** (S3-compatible uploads, images, attachments)
- **Backups** (SQLite snapshot, download + restore)
- **Logs** (requests, errors, slow queries)

This is **not a custom admin panel** — it's the upstream PocketBase UI, embedded in the same binary, on the same port. No extra service to deploy, no extra auth to wire. For production, point a Cloudflare Tunnel / Caddy ingress at the same `/_/` path and lock it down (IP allowlist, oauth2-proxy in front, or just PocketBase's own superuser auth).

## Try it live

A running deployment of this exact template is live. You can touch every feature from the README without cloning:

| What | URL | What you can do |
|------|-----|-----------------|
| **Todo demo app** | `https://<your-demo-domain>/` | Log in with the seeded demo account (`demo@demo.app` / `demo`), then watch the **event-driven DagNats onboarding** kick off automatically: step 1 greet → step 2 awaits your first todo (blocks on a `WaitForSignal`) → create a todo → the signal resumes the flow → steps 3–5 create 3 example todos + complete. Per-user (only your browser session is scoped to you, not global), event-driven (the create-todo event signals the waiting step), durable (a crash mid-wait resumes on restart because the signal KV retains the value). With `GOAI_API_KEY` set, the AI "Suggest" button appears; with `SIMULATE_LLM=true`, a keyless "Suggest (simulated)" button exercises the same queue + retry path against an in-process fake LLM (error → retry → slow). Open two browser tabs to see the **self vs. remote** animations: items you create slide in from the top with a primary tint; items other tabs create slide in from the left with an info pulse + "from someone else" indicator. Delete and reorder use the browser View Transitions API for a free cross-fade. |
| **Live PocketBase admin dashboard** | `https://<your-demo-domain>/_/` | Open the embedded PocketBase UI to browse the `todos` + `users` collections, run the REST/JS SDK playground, and inspect logs. The demo's `users` collection is **locked** — visitors can log in as the demo user but cannot create or delete accounts through the API or this dashboard (only the superuser can). |
| **Durable workflow engine (DagNats)** | `https://<your-demo-domain>:8090` | The DagNats HTTP API where the `WelcomeOnboarding` workflow runs (declarative JSON over NATS JetStream). Inspect runs/steps or trigger them via the API; the Todo demo drives it automatically on first login. |

> The demo runs `-tags dagnats` (durable workflows on `:8090`) combined with `-tags jetstream` (multi-user realtime). The two share a **single embedded NATS** on `:4222` — DagNats boots it and the realtime broadcaster attaches to it, so there is only one NATS process in the binary. To stand up your own, see [Deploy](#deploy).

## Configuring the LLM (GoAI)

The AI Suggest + Queue/Retry demo is wired through [GoAI](https://github.com/zendev-sh/goai) and reads its configuration from the environment (or your age-encrypted secrets file). Two paths:

**1. A real OpenAI-compatible provider (recommended for production).** Set `GOAI_API_KEY`, point `GOAI_BASE_URL` at the provider's `/v1` endpoint, and pick a `GOAI_MODEL`. Any OpenAI-compatible endpoint works — we do not hardcode a provider, you choose. With a key present, the Todo UI shows the **Suggest** button.

```bash
GOAI_API_KEY=sk-...
GOAI_BASE_URL=https://api.groq.com/openai/v1
GOAI_MODEL=llama-3.3-70b-versatile
```

**2. Keyless simulated LLM (best for trying the queue + retry path in dev).** Set `SIMULATE_LLM=true` to spin up an in-process fake GoAI client — no API key needed. It scripts a realistic failure (500 → retry → slow → 200) so you can watch the retry feedback toasts end-to-end. The UI shows a **Suggest (simulated)** button that reuses the exact same `goqite` + `retry-go` path as the real provider.

If `GOAI_API_KEY` is empty (and `SIMULATE_LLM` is off), the AI suggest route is **not registered** and the UI button is hidden. The Todo example keeps working — AI is opt-in, not required.

## Getting started

Use this template (green **Use this template** button above) or clone it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/calionauta/gogogo-fullstack-template.git my-project
cd my-project
make dev
```

Open `http://localhost:8080` and see the Todo App running.

> The default port is `8080` (override with `PORT`). The default branch is `master`.

### Other commands

```bash
make build            # Build binary (default: goqite + SSE Hub)
make build-jetstream  # Build with NATS JetStream (multi-user real-time). JetStream is enabled automatically under this tag — no extra env needed; set NATS_ENABLED=false to opt out.
make build-dagnats    # Build with DagNats durable workflows (JSON over NATS). DagNats is enabled automatically under this tag — no extra env needed; set DAGNATS_ENABLED=false to opt out. The engine listens on DAGNATS_HTTP_ADDR (default 127.0.0.1:8090). When built WITH -tags jetstream, the realtime broadcaster reuses the NATS that DagNats already owns on :4222 (single NATS).
make build-all        # Build with both JetStream + DagNats
make test             # Run tests with race detector (default tags)
make test-jetstream   # Run tests with JetStream tag
make test-dagnats     # Run tests with DagNats tag
make check            # Lint + size limits + dead code + CSS check
make css              # Build app.min.css (Tailwind v4 + DaisyUI v5)
make dev              # Live reload with Air
make templ            # Regenerate templ components
make setup            # Install pre-commit hooks
make docker-image     # Build and push multi-arch image to ghcr.io
```

### Build pipeline

The single compile step **outside** `go build` is the CSS build. It runs
once in the Docker builder stage and the result is embedded into the Go
binary via `//go:embed` — there is no runtime CSS build step, no JS
runtime, and no CDN.

```
src/css/input.css  →  tailwindcss v4 CLI  →  web/resources/static/app.min.css
                                                    │
                                                    └─ //go:embed in the Go binary
```

The pre-commit hook regenerates `app.min.css` automatically whenever
`.templ` or `.go` files change, and `make check` includes a `css-check`
step that fails the gate if the working CSS file is out of date.

## Local CI (gh-signoff)

Pushing to `master` triggers GitHub Actions (`ci.yml` runs the full tag
matrix, then `deploy.yml` ships to production). You can run that **exact
gate on your own machine** before pushing, so you don't wait on remote
runners (and don't push a broken commit).

We use [gh-signoff](https://github.com/basecamp/gh-signoff) — a GitHub CLI
extension that stamps a green commit status after your local tests pass.

```bash
# one-time: install the extension
gh extension install basecamp/gh-signoff

# before pushing: run the full CI matrix locally, then stamp the commit
# green (force so it stamps even before the commit is pushed)
make signoff
```

`make signoff` runs `make ci-local` (templ generate → golangci-lint →
datastar-lint → CSS check → `go test -race` across **all four** tag combos
`""` / `jetstream` / `dagnats` / `jetstream dagnats`, dagnats serialized
with `-p 1` → `go build` for all combos) and then stamps the current
commit green with `gh signoff`. `make ci-local` uses `golangci-lint` as the
authoritative formatter/lint gate (the same linter CI runs) rather than
the standalone `gofumpt` binary, which can be a newer release than the one
golangci-lint bundles and would otherwise produce false-positive listings.

> **Advisory status, by design.** This repo deploys on **push to `master`**
> (not PR merge), so the signoff status is a *signal*, not a hard gate.
> We do not run `gh signoff install` (which would gate PR merges) — it would be meaningless for a push-to-deploy flow, so we leave it off by design. If/when you move to a PR-based workflow, enable
> `gh signoff install` to make signoff a merge requirement.

## Desktop & Mobile (Wails v3 + Loro CRDT + NATS Leaf Node)

The same Go backend (PocketBase + queue + router + handlers) also runs as a
**native desktop app** via Wails v3. The desktop build reuses 100% of the
business logic — it boots `internal/server.Run`, serves PocketBase in a
goroutine, and points the webview at it through a reverse proxy.

Build the desktop shell:

```bash
make desktop            # go build -tags jetstream ./cmd/desktop  →  gogogo-desktop
# or a full native bundle (needs the wails CLI):
make wails-build        # wails build -app ./cmd/desktop -config ./wails.json -tags jetstream
```

**Edge sync.** Build the desktop with `-tags jetstream`. If
`NATS_LEAFNODE_URL` is set, the desktop boots as a **NATS Leaf Node** that
syncs its JetStream streams with your central server — offline edits replay
on reconnect. Without it, it runs a standalone embedded NATS for local
realtime. On top of that transport, **Loro CRDT** collaboration
(`internal/collab`) publishes whiteboard updates on `app.sync.<docID>` and
ephemeral multi-user **cursors** on `app.presence.<docID>`; the central
server persists resolved Loro snapshots to PocketBase (`whiteboards`
collection) and streams presence to browser clients via SSE
(`GET /api/collab/presence/{docID}`).

CI builds the four desktop bundles (`.dmg` ×2, `.exe`, `.AppImage`) in
`.github/workflows/build-platforms.yml` on every push. The full e2e gate
(incl. `TestCollab_LeafNodeE2E` and `TestPresence_SSEBridgeE2E`) runs in
`ci.yml` under `-tags "jetstream dagnats"`.

> **Mobile is experimental.** `wails build -platform android` / `ios` is a
> documented stretch goal and is **not** wired into CI or required for
> exit. The edge-sync transport (Leaf Node) and collab layers are shared,
> so a mobile target would reuse them — but the native UI bindings are
> unproven and intentionally non-blocking.

## Deploy to your own box

The default workflow is to **clone + `make dev`** for local work. For a permanent
demo, the project ships a production deploy workflow that publishes to a
server of your choosing (recommended: a small Linux box + Tailscale + a
Cloudflare-tunneled domain). No registry, no cold starts, full control.

### Server layout (multi-project standard)

Pick a directory on your server (e.g. `/opt`) and follow this layout for
**every** project that adopts the pattern — siblings share the same shape:

```
/opt/
└── gogogo-fullstack-template/                  ← this project
    ├── bin/
    │   ├── gogogo-fullstack-template             ← current binary (chmod 755)
    │   └── gogogo-fullstack-template.previous    ← prior binary, kept for fast rollback
    ├── compose/
    │   └── docker-compose.prod.yml
    ├── env/
    │   └── .env                       ← non-secret env (DATABASE_URL, APP_URL, ...)
    ├── secrets/
    │   └── gogogo-fullstack-template.env         ← mode 600, regenerated every deploy from GH Secrets
    ├── data/
    │   └── pb_data/                    ← persistent volume, survives restarts
    ├── repo/                           ← git clone of this repo (for re-syncing on each deploy)
    ├── scripts/
    │   └── deploy-prod.sh             ← the on-server deploy runner
    └── README.md                       ← operator's guide (link to this section)

/opt/<other-project>/                  ← siblings follow the same shape
    ├── bin/
    ├── compose/
    ├── env/
    ├── secrets/
    └── data/
```

### First-time setup on the server

1. Install Docker + create a `deploy` user with SSH key access.
2. Add the box to your Tailscale tailnet.
3. Configure a Cloudflare Tunnel that routes your domain (e.g. `fullstack.example.com`)
   to the Tailscale hostname on port 8080.
4. Clone the repo at `/opt/gogogo-fullstack-template/repo/` and run `./repo/scripts/setup-server.sh`
   (we ship this in a follow-up; the manual steps are: `mkdir -p bin compose env secrets data/pb_data scripts`).
5. Add the GitHub Actions secrets (see `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` for the full list).

### After setup, every push to `master` deploys

The workflow at `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` runs on every push to `master` and:

1. Builds the project (lint + race tests + CSS build).
2. Builds the production Docker image (linux/amd64 scratch) in the GH Action runner.
3. SCPs the new binary to the server as `gogogo-fullstack-template.new` (atomic swap).
4. Writes the secrets file (`/opt/gogogo-fullstack-template/secrets/gogogo-fullstack-template.env`) with mode 600.
5. SSHes in and runs `scripts/deploy-prod.sh` which:
   - Atomically renames `gogogo-fullstack-template.new` → `gogogo-fullstack-template` and keeps the old binary as `.previous`.
   - Restarts the container via `docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d`.
   - Waits up to 30s for `/health` to return 200.
6. Prints the new container status + last 20 log lines for confirmation.

Secrets are **never stored long-term on the server**: every deploy
re-renders `/opt/gogogo-fullstack-template/secrets/gogogo-fullstack-template.env` from GitHub
Actions secrets. The file is `chmod 600`, owned by the `deploy` user,
and overwritten on every run — there is no history of secrets on disk.
