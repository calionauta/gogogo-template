> **I still don't understand why GitHub keeps crediting Claude as a contributor to my repos.** My daily drivers are pi.dev with Minimax M3 and DeepSeek V4 Flash. Claude, if you're freelancing on my repositories while I'm asleep, at least start fixing the bugs too. If anyone knows how GitHub actually computes contributors, I'd genuinely love to know.

Every web project we start begins with the same conversation: pick a database, auth, router, reactive UI framework, task queue… and the project stalls at the decisions, installations, and configurations — not the code.

## Who this template is for

- **You who get tired of configuring the same stack over and over**
- **You who want everything in one binary, with no external dependencies, no Docker required.** One self-contained file. Environment-independent.
- **You who need offline-first resilience.** A Service Worker + Background Sync queue (web) and a NATS Leaf Node (desktop) let clients keep working without a connection and replay mutations on reconnect, with idempotency so replays never duplicate. See [Hybrid offline sync](#feature-overview).
- **You who prefer a single source of truth on the backend, one language for the whole stack, and reactive UI without heavy frontend frameworks** — server-rendered HTML via SSE, lightweight and fast, no bloated SPAs, no JS build step.
- **You who want a language that is predictable for both humans and LLMs.** Go's syntax is minimal and consistent. Same formatting everywhere (`gofumpt`). No surprises. Static typing catches whole classes of bugs at compile time. Native concurrency (goroutines + channels) that is easy to reason about — no async/await chains, no callback pyramids. This makes the codebase equally readable by you, your team, and AI coding agents.
- **You who care about supply chain security.** Go has no mass npm-style dependency trees. Every module is verified by content hash (`go.sum`). Built-in vulnerability auditing (`govulncheck`) scans your dependency graph for known CVEs. No transitive dependency hell.
- **You who want an LLM client wired in without pulling in a whole orchestration framework** — `internal/llm` wraps GoAI (any OpenAI-compatible provider) behind an injectable interface, callable from handlers. It calls a *remote* provider API; it is **not** a local-model runtime.

## What's in the package

Everything you need to build a modern web app, in a single binary:

| Layer | Choice | Why |
|-------|--------|-----|
| **Language** | Go 1.26 | Fast compilation, easy deploy, lean runtime |
| **Database + Auth + API** | [PocketBase](https://pocketbase.io) (embedded, on `ncruces/go-sqlite3`) | Zero-config auth, REST, [admin UI at `/_/`](https://<your-domain>/_/), file storage — all in SQLite |
| **Templating** | [Templ](https://templ.guide) | Type-safe Go components, generated at build time |
| **Reactive UI** | [Datastar](https://data-star.dev) (SSE) | Server-rendered over SSE, single ~12 KiB client. CSS built once via Tailwind v4 CLI; no JS framework build step. |
| **CSS** | [DaisyUI v5](https://daisyui.com) + TailwindCSS | Ready components, customizable, ~34kB minified |
| **Task queue** | [goqite](https://github.com/maragudk/goqite) + SSE Hub | Background jobs streamed to the browser, no Redis |
| **Retries** | [avast/retry-go v4](https://github.com/avast/retry-go) | Exponential backoff with jitter, no boilerplate |
| **Durable Workflows** | [DagNats](https://github.com/danmestas/dagnats) | Multi-step durable workflows as declarative JSON over NATS JetStream |
| **LLM SDK** | [GoAI](https://github.com/zendev-sh/goai) | Any provider: OpenAI, Anthropic, Groq, Ollama… |
| **Real-time** | [NATS JetStream](https://nats.io) | Multi-user real-time, cross-instance broadcast |
| **Secrets** | [age](https://age-encryption.org) + `~/.secrets/` | Local encryption, no vault, no cloud |
| **IDs** | [google/uuid](https://github.com/google/uuid) | Stable request/job IDs |
| **Live reload** | [Air](https://github.com/air-verse/air) | `make dev` regenerates templ and restarts the binary |
| **CRDT (collaborative docs)** | [loro-go](https://github.com/aholstenson/loro-go) | Conflict-free merging of whiteboard/notes state; converges offline edits with no LWW data loss |
| **Hand-drawn canvas** | [Rough.js](https://roughjs.com) (embedded) | Minimalist sketchy whiteboard rendering, embedded in the binary for self-contained removal with the whiteboard feature |
| **Linting** | [golangci-lint](https://golangci-lint.run) + [datastar-lint](https://github.com/calionauta/datastar-lint) | 27 linters: `govet`, `staticcheck`, `gosec`, `revive`, `gocritic`, `errcheck`, `ineffassign`, `unused`, `errorlint`, `nilerr`, `bodyclose`, `contextcheck`, `containedctx`, `sloglint`, `thelper`, `testifylint`, `gocyclo`, `gocognit`, `funlen`, `noctx`, `goconst`, `dupl`, `lll`, `mnd`, `tagliatelle`, `modernize`, `nolintlint` (see `.golangci.yml`); `datastar-lint` catches Datastar attribute/signal/expression mistakes (run via `make datastar-lint`) |
| **CI/CD** | GitHub Actions | `ci.yml` (lint + test + build, unified build) + `deploy.yml` (multi-arch Docker to ghcr.io, runs on `master`) |

> **Why `ncruces/go-sqlite3`?** It's the pure-Go (no cgo) SQLite engine this template standardizes on. The build uses `-tags no_default_driver` to drop `modernc.org/sqlite`, so ncruces is what actually powers every query — and being cgo-free means clean cross-compilation for the multi-arch Docker image (linux/amd64 + arm64) and the Wails desktop/mobile builds. That's why `db/pocketbase.go` registers its driver init.

## Stack in layers, not silos

Most templates force you to pick one async strategy — usually a queue, sometimes a workflow runtime, rarely both. Real apps need **a queue for background jobs**, **a workflow runtime for durable multi-step processes**, **a collaboration layer for conflict-free state merging**, and **a real-time layer for cross-client state** — each solving a different problem. We ship all five in one unified build.

We solve this with **six complementary layers**:

```
goqite       → background jobs + SSE hub (always on)
dagnats      → durable multi-step workflows as JSON (runtime opt-out: DAGNATS_ENABLED=false)
Loro CRDT    → collaborative docs with offline merges (opt-out by removing internal/collab/)
PB realtime  → record-change push via PB's native /api/realtime (always on, per-user scoped)
SSE Hub      → ephemeral signals via Datastar protocol (always on, part of queue)
JetStream    → multi-instance broadcast + cross-instance state (runtime opt-out: NATS_ENABLED=false)
```

**Two realtime mechanisms for different jobs.** PocketBase's native `/api/realtime` pushes record mutations (create/toggle/delete) to subscribers, scoped per-user by the collection's access rules. The **SSE Hub** (`internal/queue/ssehub.go`) is reserved for ephemeral signals (client count, LLM suggest feedback, workflow progress, self-patches) and delivers them via Datastar's SSE protocol (`internal/datastar.RenderAndPatch` / `MergeSignals`). The todo feature uses both: PB realtime for CRUD propagation, SSE Hub for toasts and live hints. The whiteboard uses the SSE Hub directly for shape + presence broadcast.

**Cross-instance sync adds two more paths.** When JetStream is enabled (default: on), the **NATS APP_CRUD stream** converges record operations across server instances: CrudPublisher publishes each mutation, CrudConsumer on the receiving instance writes to its local PocketBase, which then broadcasts via PB realtime to its local clients. The **NATS TODOS stream** carries ephemeral signals across instances and re-emits them through the local SSE Hub. Both are safe to enable even on a single instance — the streams simply carry no cross-instance traffic.

**Offline sync uses yet another path.** On the web, the **Service Worker** (`web/resources/static/sw.js`) intercepts POST/PUT/DELETE mutations when the browser is offline, queues them in IndexedDB, and replays them via Background Sync when connectivity returns. On the desktop (NATS Leaf Node), the local JetStream persists mutations to disk and replays them when the Leaf Node reconnects to the server — no Service Worker needed.

**Replay is dedup'd at the server.** The todo create form attaches a fresh `idem_key` UUID to every submit; `db/idempotency_hook.go` intercepts `OnRecordCreateRequest` and returns the existing record on a `(idem_key, owner)` match, so a Service Worker replay doesn't create a duplicate todo. The whiteboard avoids this entirely because Loro CRDT ops already carry unique IDs and converge idempotently on their own.

**The opt-out rules are simple:**
- **Infrastructure components** (NATS, DagNats) have runtime env vars in `config/config.go`. Set `NATS_ENABLED=false` or `DAGNATS_ENABLED=false` and the engine won't boot; downstream consumers handle nil gracefully.
- **Product features** (Todo, Whiteboard) have no runtime flag. To remove them, delete the package directory and remove the wiring call from `router/router.go` — that's the SCOPE removal pattern. See [Architecture taxonomy](#architecture-taxonomy-core--pluggable--feature).

They coexist in the same binary. They don't compete.

**One `make build` compiles everything.** No build tags, no stub files, no matrix. DagNats and NATS share a single embedded JetStream on `:4222`.

**Offline-first is baked in, not bolted on.** Web clients intercept mutations in a Service Worker and replay them via Background Sync; the desktop build becomes a NATS Leaf Node that keeps its JetStream replica in sync while offline. Replays are deduplicated server-side (the todo create form attaches an `idem_key` that the idempotency hook collapses). See [Hybrid offline sync](#feature-overview).

## Feature overview

Every capability is always compiled. What you get:

| Capability | Runtime opt-out | What it does |
|-----------|----------------|--------------|
| **Todo app + PocketBase realtime** | — | DB actions (create/toggle/delete) stream through PocketBase realtime, per-user scoped via `owner` rule. SSE Hub for ephemeral signals (toasts, clients count, AI suggest) |
| **Queue + retry** | — | `goqite` background jobs + `retry-go` (the "Queue + Retry" demo) |
| **AI Suggest** | `GOAI_API_KEY` unset | GoAI/Groq call from the todo UI; button hidden when no key |
| **Collaborative whiteboard** | — | Loro CRDT + Rough.js canvas, SSE + NATS broadcast, offline-first outbox replay, PocketBase-persisted snapshots |
| **Multi-instance real-time** | `NATS_ENABLED=false` | NATS JetStream fan-out for todo + whiteboard sync across >1 instance behind a LB |
| **Durable workflows** | `DAGNATS_ENABLED=false` | DagNats JSON workflows — HTTP API on `:8090`, durable state on JetStream `:4222` (e.g. `WelcomeOnboarding`) |
| **Desktop-edge sync** | `NATS_LEAFNODE_URL` unset | Leaf-Node JetStream replication of Loro updates for desktop/edge clients |
| **Hybrid offline sync** | `OFFLINE_SYNC_ENABLED=false` | Disables NATS CRUD proxy + Service Worker offline queue (default on). When enabled: desktop edges publish CRUD ops via NATS JetStream, the server's CrudConsumer writes to PocketBase. Web clients use Service Worker + Background Sync for offline queuing and replay. Toggle with a single env var — set to `false` for always-online deployments, and zero code paths are traversed. |

> **Adding a new feature?** Create `features/<name>/` with your handlers + templates. Wire it in `router/router.go` → `Init()` with a single function call. See `ARCHITECTURE.md` for the full pattern.

## Architecture taxonomy: Core / Pluggable / Feature

Every file in the codebase carries a `SCOPE` annotation at the top to tell agents and developers what can be safely removed:

| Annotation | Meaning | Examples | You would… |
|------------|---------|----------|------------|
| `SCOPE:core` 🔴 | Binary does not work without it. Some have runtime opt-out via env vars. | `config/`, `db/`, `internal/queue/`, `internal/secrets/`, `features/auth/` (middleware), `router/`, `web/resources/` | Customize, never remove. |
| `SCOPE:pluggable` 🟡 | Binary works but loses a capability. Swap or delete with its wiring call. | `internal/datastar/`, `internal/nats/`, `internal/dagnats/`, `internal/llm/`, `internal/collab/` | Swap for another implementation, or delete the package + wiring call (e.g. `router.Init`, `cmd/web/main.go`). |
| `SCOPE:feature` 🟢 | A demo/add-on. Delete the package + remove the wiring call. | `features/todo/`, `features/whiteboard/`, `router/onboarding_dagnats.go`, `router/realtime_jet.go` | Keep as reference while building your own, then remove. |

**Rule of thumb for agents:** If you see a `SCOPE` annotation on a file, respect it. Never delete a `SCOPE:core` file without asking. Never keep a `SCOPE:feature` file in production if the domain doesn't need it.

### How to remove a pluggable or feature component

1. Delete the package directory (e.g. `features/todo/`).
2. Delete dependent packages listed in the `Depends on:` comment.
3. Remove the wiring call from `router/router.go` → `Init()`.
4. If it was pluggable, also remove the `start*` call in `cmd/web/main.go`.

See `ARCHITECTURE.md` for the full dependency graph.

## Code quality for LLM agents

This template ships a strict `golangci-lint` configuration (27 linters) designed to catch the kinds of mistakes LLMs make most often: unchecked errors, insecure patterns, broken context propagation, resource leaks, and inconsistent error wrapping. The goal is not to block development but to redirect agents toward correct Go idioms automatically.

**What the linters enforce:**

| Category | Linters | What they catch |
|----------|---------|-----------------|
| Correctness | `govet`, `staticcheck`, `errcheck`, `ineffassign`, `unused` | Shadowed variables, dead code, unchecked returns |
| Error handling | `errorlint`, `nilerr`, `gosec` | Wrong `%w` formatting, returning nil inside an error path, hardcoded credentials |
| Resource safety | `bodyclose`, `noctx` | HTTP bodies and contexts not closed or propagated |
| Test quality | `thelper`, `testifylint`, `sloglint`, `containedctx` | Missing `t.Helper()`, `assert` vs `require` misuse, context embedded in structs |
| Complexity | `gocyclo`, `gocognit`, `funlen`, `nestif` (implicit via funlen+gocyclo) | Functions too long or too nested to hold in working memory |
| Style | `revive`, `gocritic`, `tagliatelle`, `goconst`, `dupl`, `lll`, `modernize` | Non-idiomatic patterns, magic numbers, duplicated code, long lines |
| Formatting | `gofumpt` + `goimports` (formatters, not linters) | Compulsory consistent layout and import ordering |

**For LLM agents reading this:** before editing any Go file, run `make ci-local` to establish a baseline. After making changes, run `make lint` to verify the linters pass. The `golangci-lint` configuration lives in `.golangci.yml` at the project root — read it if you need to understand what each linter expects. If a lint forces you to restructure code, that is usually a sign the original approach had a deeper issue.

**For human developers:** `make ci-local` runs the full gate (templ + datastar-lint + css-check + golangci-lint + race tests + build). `make lint` runs just `go vet` + `golangci-lint`. We deliberately keep `gofumpt` and `goimports` as formatters (not linters) so `golangci-lint run` never auto-formats your files — formatting is a separate explicit step.

**How to run each lint layer:**

| Command | What it checks |
|---------|---------------|
| `make lint` | `go vet` + golangci-lint (27 linters) |
| `make datastar-lint` | Datastar-specific anti-patterns in `.templ` files |
| `make fmt` | `gofumpt` + `goimports` formatting only |
| `make ci-local` | Full local gate, identical to CI: templ → datastar-lint → css-check → golangci-lint → race tests → build |

The pre-commit hook (`make setup`) runs `gofumpt`, `goimports`, `datastar-lint`, a CSS staleness check, `go mod tidy`, and `golangci-lint` on every commit — so formatting and lint violations never reach the remote. Run `make ci-local` for the full gate (adds tests + build) before pushing.

## The example: Todo App with realtime

We ship a working Todo App:

- Full CRUD via PocketBase
- Reactive UI with Datastar + DaisyUI
- **Database actions stream through PocketBase realtime.** Todo `create`/`toggle`/`delete` fire PocketBase record events; each subscribed client re-fetches the fragment and morphs `#todo-list`. Delivery is per-user scoped by the collection's `owner` rule (`@request.auth.id != '' && owner = @request.auth.id`), so a client only receives events for its own records. The SSE Hub is reserved for ephemeral signals (success/retry toasts, live clients count, AI suggest) and the originating client's own synchronous patch.
- Stacked toast notifications (auto-dismiss, manual close, progress bar)
- Async jobs: `handleCreate` enqueues a `todo_created` job; a worker picks it up and streams a success toast to the right browser tab via the SSE Hub (`clientID` routing)
- Retries with exponential backoff and jitter (`internal/queue/retry.go`, retry-go v4) — SSE-aware: a retry emits a `lastRetry` signal so the UI can show "retrying…"
- `WelcomeOnboarding` DagNats workflow (always compiled) that creates 3 example todos via durable steps — kill the server mid-run, restart, watch it resume at the last incomplete step. The workflow is declarative JSON (`internal/dagnats/workflow.go`), so renaming Go handlers never orphans an in-flight run.
- **Admin unlock** via `age` + `~/.secrets/`. The Todo example wires a master-password path: when `ADMIN_UNLOCK_TOKEN` is set (in the age-encrypted secrets file), the UI shows a "Clear all" form; the handler compares constant-time and clears all todos on match. Demonstrates the age flow end-to-end.
- **AI suggest** via GoAI. When `GOAI_API_KEY` is set, the input gets a "Suggest" button that enqueues an async suggest job (see queue below) and streams the 3 completions back via SSE. It talks to whatever OpenAI-compatible provider `GOAI_BASE_URL`/`GOAI_MODEL` point at — see [Configuring the LLM](#configuring-the-llm-goai). Retries with exponential backoff use the same `internal/queue/retry.go` as the SSE toast path. For a **keyless** demo of the exact same queue + retry path, `SIMULATE_LLM` is on by default (opt out with `SIMULATE_LLM=false`): a "Suggest (simulated)" button enqueues a job that hits an in-process fake LLM scripting 500 → 200 + delay, so you can watch the retry feedback toasts (enqueued → attempt failed → slow → result).
- Tests run with `-race`

> **This is the contract you should imitate when adding a new feature:**
> 1. **Pure HTTP + Datastar** for the user-facing surface.
> 2. **goqite job** for any work that takes more than ~50ms (LLM, email, exports).
> 3. **SSE toast** for async feedback to the originating client via `clientID` routing.
> 4. **age-encrypted secret** if the feature needs a credential.
> Every existing feature (toast on create, AI suggest, admin unlock, DagNats onboarding) follows this exact shape.

Enough to understand the pattern.

## Adding your own feature

Every feature in this template follows the same pattern. Use it as a blueprint when building yours:

1. Create `features/<name>/` with your HTTP handlers + Templ components.
2. Wire it in `router/router.go` → `Init()` with a single function call.
3. Use **goqite** for async work, **SSE Hub** for user-facing feedback (toasts, progress), and **Datastar** for reactive UI.
4. Add `SCOPE:feature` or `SCOPE:core` annotations so agents know what they can remove.
5. Add a `RegisterRoutes(se, deps)` function and call it from `router.Init`.

See the Todo feature for the full reference implementation.

## Admin & Dashboard

Two built-in admin surfaces, available as soon as the binary boots:

| Surface | URL | What it gives you |
|---------|-----|-------------------|
| **PocketBase admin** | `/_/` | Data browser, REST playground, superuser management, backups, logs |
| **DagNats console** | `:8090` | Workflow runs, step inspection, JSON API for durable workflows |

> The admin UI is the **upstream PocketBase UI**, embedded in the same binary on the same port. No extra service to deploy. Point a Cloudflare Tunnel at `/_/` and lock it down with PocketBase's own superuser auth.

### PocketBase admin UI (`/_/`)

- **Visual data browser** for every collection (todos, users, etc.) with sort/filter/CSV export
- **REST + JS SDK playground** for the API endpoints PocketBase generated from your schema
- **Superuser management** (create the first one via the install link printed in the server logs)
- **File storage** (S3-compatible uploads, images, attachments)
- **Backups** (SQLite snapshot, download + restore)
- **Logs** (requests, errors, slow queries)

This is **not a custom admin panel** — it's the upstream PocketBase UI, embedded in the same binary, on the same port. No extra service to deploy, no extra auth to wire. For production, point a Cloudflare Tunnel / Caddy ingress at the same `/_/` path and lock it down (IP allowlist, oauth2-proxy in front, or just PocketBase's own superuser auth).

### App session cookie vs `pb_auth` (why two)

The app **never** reuses PocketBase's own `pb_auth` cookie. PocketBase keeps the superuser (`_superusers`) and regular users as **separate auth namespaces with different endpoints**, and a single client holds only **one** auth state (one cookie). Sharing `pb_auth` for the app session clobbers the admin session in the same browser (and vice-versa) — a well-known PocketBase gotcha ([#5050](https://github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/issues/5050), [#1780](https://github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/issues/1780)).

So login issues **two** cookies:

- `gogogo_auth` — the app's own session cookie, read by `LoadAuthFromCookie`.
- `pb_auth` — the same token under PocketBase's native name, so PB-native surfaces (notably the `/api/realtime` SSE channel for record-change subscriptions) authenticate as the same user. Without it, realtime record events are silently dropped by PB's per-subscriber access check.

The split is **intentional, not tech debt** — keep the two cookies separate. **Best practice:** run the admin UI on a separate origin/port (e.g. `:8090/_/`) so even `pb_auth` never collides between admin and app.

### DagNats console (`:8090`)

The DagNats workflow engine exposes its own HTTP API + console at `DAGNATS_HTTP_ADDR` (default `127.0.0.1:8090`). Inspect runs, steps, or trigger workflows via the API. The `WelcomeOnboarding` workflow runs here — declarative JSON over NATS JetStream, kickstarted automatically on first login.

## Try it live

A running deployment of this exact template is live. You can touch every feature from the README without cloning:

| What | URL | What you can do |
|------|-----|-----------------|
| **Todo demo app** | `https://gogogo.calionauta.com/` | Log in with the seeded demo account (`demo@demo.app` / `demo`). |
| **Live PocketBase admin dashboard** | `https://gogogo.calionauta.com/_/` | Open the embedded PocketBase UI to browse the `todos` + `users` collections, run the REST/JS SDK playground, and inspect logs. The demo's `users` collection is **locked** — visitors can log in as the demo user but cannot create or delete accounts through the API or this dashboard (only the superuser can). |
| **Durable workflow engine (DagNats)** | `https://gogogo.calionauta.com:8090` | The DagNats HTTP API where the `WelcomeOnboarding` workflow runs (declarative JSON over NATS JetStream). Inspect runs/steps or trigger them via the API; the Todo demo drives it automatically on first login. |

> The demo runs the unified build (everything compiled in). DagNats + NATS share a **single embedded JetStream** on `:4222` — DagNats boots it and the whiteboard SyncWorker attaches to it, so there is only one NATS process in the binary. To stand up your own, see [Deploy](#deploy).

## Configuring the LLM (GoAI)

The AI Suggest + Queue/Retry demo is wired through [GoAI](https://github.com/zendev-sh/goai) and reads its configuration from the environment (or your age-encrypted secrets file). Two paths:

**1. A real OpenAI-compatible provider (recommended for production).** Set `GOAI_API_KEY`, point `GOAI_BASE_URL` at the provider's `/v1` endpoint, and pick a `GOAI_MODEL`. Any OpenAI-compatible endpoint works — we do not hardcode a provider, you choose. With a key present, the Todo UI shows the **Suggest** button.

```bash
GOAI_API_KEY=sk-...
GOAI_BASE_URL=https://api.groq.com/openai/v1
GOAI_MODEL=llama-3.3-70b-versatile
```

**2. Keyless simulated LLM (on by default — best for trying the queue + retry path in dev).** `SIMULATE_LLM` is enabled automatically (no API key needed); set `SIMULATE_LLM=false` to disable it. It spins up an in-process fake GoAI client that scripts a realistic failure (500 → retry → slow → 200) so you can watch the retry feedback toasts end-to-end. The UI shows a **Suggest (simulated)** button that reuses the exact same `goqite` + `retry-go` path as the real provider.

If neither `GOAI_API_KEY` is set nor `SIMULATE_LLM` is enabled (i.e. `SIMULATE_LLM=false` and no key), the AI suggest route is **not registered** and the UI button is hidden. The Todo example keeps working — AI is opt-in, not required.

## Getting started

Use this template (green **Use this template** button above) or clone it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/calionauta/gogogo-fullstack-template.git my-project
cd my-project
make dev
```

Open `http://localhost:8080` and see the Todo App running.

> The default port is `8080` (override with `PORT`). The default branch is `master`.

### Other commands

```bash
make build      # Build binary (unified: everything included)
make test       # Run tests with race detector (-p 1 for DagNats engine stability)
make ci-local   # Full local gate: templ + datastar-lint + css-check + golangci-lint + race tests + build
make css        # Build app.min.css (Tailwind v4 + DaisyUI v5)
make dev        # Live reload with Air
make templ      # Regenerate templ components
make lint       # go vet + golangci-lint (27 linters)
make fmt        # gofumpt + goimports formatting
make setup      # Install pre-commit + pre-push hooks
make docker-image  # Build and push multi-arch image to ghcr.io
```

### Build pipeline

The single compile step **outside** `go build` is the CSS build. It runs
once in the Docker builder stage and the result is embedded into the Go
binary via `//go:embed` — there is no runtime CSS build step, no JS
runtime, and no CDN.

```
src/css/input.css  →  tailwindcss v4 CLI  →  web/resources/static/app.min.css
                                                    │
                                                    └─ //go:embed in the Go binary
```

The pre-commit hook regenerates `app.min.css` automatically whenever
`.templ` or `.go` files change, and `make ci-local` includes a `css-check`
step that fails the gate if the working CSS file is out of date.

## Local CI (gh-signoff)

Pushing to `master` triggers GitHub Actions (`ci.yml` runs the full gate,
then `deploy.yml` ships to production). You can run that **exact
gate on your own machine** before pushing, so you don't wait on remote
runners (and don't push a broken commit).

We use [gh-signoff](https://github.com/basecamp/gh-signoff) — a GitHub CLI
extension that stamps a green commit status after your local tests pass.

```bash
# one-time: install the extension
gh extension install basecamp/gh-signoff

# before pushing: run the full CI gate locally, then stamp the commit
# green (force so it stamps even before the commit is pushed)
make signoff
```

`make signoff` runs `make ci-local` (templ generate → golangci-lint →
datastar-lint → CSS check → `go test -race -p 1` → `go build`) and then
stamps the current commit green with `gh signoff`. `make ci-local` uses
`golangci-lint` as the authoritative formatter/lint gate (the same linter
CI runs) rather than the standalone `gofumpt` binary, which can be a newer
release than the one golangci-lint bundles and would otherwise produce
false-positive listings. **The dependency runs one way: `signoff` calls `ci-local`; `ci-local` never calls `signoff`** — that keeps the local gate clean to run on its own, and reserves the git-stamp for the explicit pre-push moment.

> **Advisory status, by design.** This repo deploys on **push to `master`**
> (not PR merge), so the signoff status is a *signal*, not a hard gate.
> We do not run `gh signoff install` (which would gate PR merges) — it would be meaningless for a push-to-deploy flow, so we leave it off by design.

## Desktop & Mobile (Wails v3 + Loro CRDT + NATS Leaf Node)

The same Go backend (PocketBase + queue + router + handlers) also runs as a
**native desktop app** via Wails v3. The desktop build reuses 100% of the
business logic — it boots `internal/server.Run`, serves PocketBase in a
goroutine, and points the webview at it through a reverse proxy.

Build commands (Wails v3 CLI):

```bash
# Current platform
wails3 build
# Cross-platform
wails3 build GOOS=windows
wails3 build GOOS=linux
wails3 build GOOS=darwin GOARCH=arm64
# macOS .app bundle
wails3 package GOOS=darwin
# Android APK (needs Android SDK/NDK + JDK 21 — see Mobile below)
wails3 android:package
```

All builds compile with everything included (unified build).
If you prefer a plain binary without the wails CLI, `make desktop` runs
`go build ./cmd/desktop`.

**Edge sync.** If `NATS_LEAFNODE_URL` is set, the desktop boots as a **NATS Leaf Node** that
syncs its JetStream streams with your central server — offline edits replay
on reconnect. Without it, it runs a standalone embedded NATS for local
realtime. On top of that transport, **Loro CRDT** collaboration
(`internal/collab`) publishes whiteboard updates on `app.sync.<docID>` and
ephemeral multi-user **cursors** on `app.presence.<docID>`; the central
server persists resolved Loro snapshots to PocketBase (`whiteboards`
collection) and streams presence to browser clients via SSE
(`GET /api/collab/presence/{docID}`).

**Desktop builds are local-only — not in CI.** Generate them with the
commands above: `wails3 build` for a binary, `wails3 package GOOS=darwin`
for a macOS `.app` (wrap in a `.dmg` with `hdiutil` if you want a
redistributable installer). Keeping the desktop out of CI keeps the pipeline
lean; the full e2e gate (incl. `TestCollab_LeafNodeE2E` and
`TestPresence_SSEBridgeE2E`) still runs in `ci.yml` under the unified build.

> **Mobile (Android) is opt-in, not in CI.** Wails v3 targets Android from
the same `main.go` (Go → `libwails.so`, WebView frontend) — no separate
mobile project. Generate an APK locally with `wails3 android:package`
(or `android:package:fat`). This requires the **Android SDK (API 35) +
NDK (26.3.x) + JDK 21**; `wails3 doctor` reports what's missing. Because
that toolchain is heavy, APK builds are left to the developer and are not
part of the CI matrix. iOS is analogous but requires Xcode.

## Deploy to your own box

The default workflow is to **clone + `make dev`** for local work. For a permanent
demo, the project ships a production deploy workflow that publishes to a
server of your choosing (recommended: a small Linux box + Tailscale + a
Cloudflare-tunneled domain). No registry, no cold starts, full control.

### Server layout (multi-project standard)

Pick a directory on your server (e.g. `/opt`) and follow this layout for
**every** project that adopts the pattern — siblings share the same shape:

```
/opt/
└── gogogo-fullstack-template/                  ← this project
    ├── bin/
    │   ├── gogogo-fullstack-template             ← current binary (chmod 755)
    │   └── gogogo-fullstack-template.previous    ← prior binary, kept for fast rollback
    ├── compose/
    │   └── docker-compose.prod.yml
    ├── env/
    │   └── .env                       ← non-secret env (DATABASE_URL, APP_URL, ...)
    ├── secrets/
    │   └── gogogo-fullstack-template.env         ← mode 600, regenerated every deploy from GH Secrets
    ├── data/
    │   └── pb_data/                    ← persistent volume, survives restarts
    ├── repo/                           ← git clone of this repo (for re-syncing on each deploy)
    ├── scripts/
    │   └── deploy-prod.sh             ← the on-server deploy runner
    └── README.md                       ← operator's guide (link to this section)

/opt/<other-project>/                  ← siblings follow the same shape
    ├── bin/
    ├── compose/
    ├── env/
    ├── secrets/
    └── data/
```

### First-time setup on the server

1. Install Docker + create a `deploy` user with SSH key access.
2. Add the box to your Tailscale tailnet.
3. Configure a Cloudflare Tunnel that routes your domain (e.g. `fullstack.example.com`)
   to the Tailscale hostname on port 8080.
4. Clone the repo at `/opt/gogogo-fullstack-template/repo/`. A `setup-server.sh` helper is planned as a follow-up; for now run the manual steps: `mkdir -p bin compose env secrets data/pb_data scripts`.
5. Add the GitHub Actions secrets (see `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` for the full list).

### After setup, every push to `master` deploys

The workflow at `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` runs on every push to `master` and:

1. Builds the project (lint + race tests + CSS build).
2. Builds the production Docker image (linux/amd64 scratch) in the GH Action runner.
3. SCPs the new binary to the server as `gogogo-fullstack-template.new` (atomic swap).
4. Writes the secrets file (`/opt/gogogo-fullstack-template/secrets/gogogo-fullstack-template.env`) with mode 600.
5. SSHes in and runs `scripts/deploy-prod.sh` which:
   - Atomically renames `gogogo-fullstack-template.new` → `gogogo-fullstack-template` and keeps the old binary as `.previous`.
   - Restarts the container via `docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d`.
   - Waits up to 30s for `/health` to return 200.
6. Prints the new container status + last 20 log lines for confirmation.

Secrets are **never stored long-term on the server**: every deploy
re-renders `/opt/gogogo-fullstack-template/secrets/gogogo-fullstack-template.env` from GitHub
Actions secrets. The file is `chmod 600`, owned by the `deploy` user,
and overwritten on every run — there is no history of secrets on disk.

### Key configuration constants

| Constant | Location | Default | Purpose |
|----------|----------|---------|---------|
| `DefaultReplayBufferSize` | `config/config.go` | 64 | Per-client SSE replay ring-buffer size (was `internal/queue/ssehub.go`) |
| `DefaultClientQueueSize` | `config/config.go` | 64 | Per-client SSE channel buffer (was `internal/queue/ssehub.go`) |
| `DefaultSSEHeartbeatInterval` | `config/config.go` | 15s | SSE heartbeat interval (was `internal/queue/ssehub.go`) |
| `OfflineSync.Enabled` | `config/config.go` | `true` | Toggle hybrid offline-sync-online. Set `OFFLINE_SYNC_ENABLED=false` to opt out. |
| `DefaultBaseURL` (GoAI) | `internal/llm/goai.go` | `https://api.openai.com/v1` | OpenAI-compatible base URL |
| `DefaultModel` (GoAI) | `internal/llm/goai.go` | `gpt-4o-mini` | Default LLM model |

All are configurable in one place (env var in `config/config.go`, runtime constant in `config/config.go` or the owning package). Change it once, every feature picks up the new value.

> **Why some constants are NOT in config.go?** Runtime constants that are implementation details of a single package (like `DefaultBaseURL` in `internal/llm/goai.go`) stay in that package to keep cohesion. `config/config.go` documents every env var and the most commonly tuned runtime constants.
