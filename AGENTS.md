# gogogo-fullstack-template

> Full-stack Go web app template — back-end + front-end + DB + auth + LLM + deploy in one binary.

## Project Overview

Go template: Datastar + Templ + PocketBase + goqite + DagNats + NATS JetStream.
Module: `github.com/calionauta/gogogo-fullstack-template`

**Naming:** repo, module, binary, deploy dir (`/home/deploy/<APP_NAME>/`), container, and tunnel hostname all share the project name. Replace `gogogo-fullstack-template` everywhere when cloning.

**Unified build.** `go build ./cmd/web` or `make build` compiles **everything** — no build tags. Every feature (queue, workflows, realtime, whiteboard, onboarding) is always included. Opt out at runtime via env vars like `NATS_ENABLED=false`, `DAGNATS_ENABLED=false`.

## Stack (exact versions)

Go 1.26 | Templ v0.3.1020 | Datastar v1.2.2 | PocketBase v0.39.5 (ncruces/go-sqlite3) | TailwindCSS v4.1.13 + DaisyUI v5.6.15 | goqite v0.4.0 | retry-go v4 | DagNats v0.0.5 | NATS JetStream | age v1.3.1 | uuid v1.6.0

Skills: `cali-coding-go-standards` (code quality), `cali-code-navigation` (cymbal-first search). Install via `npx skills add .../cali-coding-go-standards`.

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `make dev` | Air live reload (gofumpt + vet + golangci-lint info) |
| `make build` | Unified build — `go build` ONLY (no lint, no tests) |
| `make test` | Race tests (`-p 1` for DagNats engine stability); discouraged locally — the remote CI runs them |
| `make templ` | Generate Templ |
| `make datastar-lint` | Lint `.templ` via datastar-lint (`-only-errors` keeps intentional custom attrs) |
| `make css` / `make css-check` | Rebuild Tailwind/DaisyUI bundle; `css-check` compares against HEAD (used in `ci-local`) |
| `make ci-local` | **Single gate** (= CI): templ + datastar-lint + css-check + golangci-lint + race tests + build |
| `make signoff` | `ci-local` + `gh signoff` stamp (advisory on push-to-master) |
| `make setup` | Blocking pre-commit + pre-push hooks (pre-push adds `govulncheck`) |

> **`make check` was removed.** It was a subset of `make ci-local` (no
> build verification, smaller lint set). The single source of truth
> for "is the gate green" is `make ci-local`.

## Don'ts

- NO HTMX/Alpine — use Datastar. NO `fmt.Sprintf` for HTML — use Templ.
- NO raw CSS class when a DaisyUI component exists. NO `log` — use `log/slog`.
- Driver is `ncruces/go-sqlite3` — never switch to PocketBase's bundled modernc as the active driver. (modernc is still pulled in by PocketBase but registers `sqlite` and stays unused; ncruces registers `sqlite3` and is what every query uses.) NO removing goqite when adding JetStream; they solve different problems.
- NO manual `id` on PocketBase records (PK Max=15, `^[a-z0-9]+$`).
- NO Datastar `PatchElements` whose top-level element lacks `id` + `WithSelector` (client throws `PatchElementsNoTargetsFound`). Use `internal/datastar.RenderAndPatch` paired with a selector.
- NO real LLM in tests — inject a stub (`internal/llm/fakeserver` only inside `internal/llm/`).
- **Prefer Datastar attributes** (`data-on:*`, signals, expressions, `__window`/`__document` modifiers) over vanilla JS for client-side logic. Inline JS only when unavoidable, kept adjacent to the markup (locality of behavior).

## SCOPE annotations (read before editing)

Every source file carries a `SCOPE` comment at the top showing its removal risk.

| Annotation | Meaning | You would… |
|------------|---------|------------|
| `SCOPE:core` 🔴 | Binary does not work without it. | Customize, never remove. |
| `SCOPE:plugin` 🟡 | Binary works but loses capability. Has removal instructions. | Swap or delete with wiring call. |
| `SCOPE:feature` 🟢 | A demo/add-on. Has removal instructions and dependency notes. | Delete package + wiring call. |

**Agent rule:** When the user asks to trim the project, never delete a `SCOPE:core` file — always ask first. Delete `SCOPE:feature` and `SCOPE:plugin` files freely, following their "Remove by" comments.

## Testing discipline (learned the hard way)

Lessons from v0.18.0 (offline-add + CI flake) — see CHANGELOG.md.

- **One unified build, no feature build tags.** `go build ./cmd/web` (or `make build`) compiles everything with no `-tags`. `ncruces/go-sqlite3` is the always-on driver (registered as `sqlite3`); PocketBase also bundles `modernc.org/sqlite` but it registers `sqlite` and stays unused, so tests need no special tag. Tests bootstrap PocketBase via `app.Bootstrap()` with our `DBConnect` (ncruces `sqlite3`) and just run — no `Bootstrap` panic, no tag matrix to forget.
- **Avoid package-level mutable globals.** `var NS/NC/JS *Foo` set by `StartX()` and torn down by `Stop()` leak across `-p 1` packages when `Stop` doesn't nil them. Either nil on entry/exit or, better, return a struct. See `internal/nats/embedded.go` for the belt-and-suspenders nil-out.
- **Pre-commit MUST rebuild `.templ` AND CSS.** Editing a `.templ` without `make templ && make css` leaves `web/resources/static/app.min.css` stale. `css-check` passes by inertia when nobody rebuilt, masking the staleness until a real diff appears.
- **Local feedback is T1–T4; sign locally before push.** See the Feedback loop section below. The cheapest reliable pre-push gate is `make signoff` (= T4 + `gh signoff` stamp). It catches ~95%% of issues in <3min locally — race detector races, lint, format drift, CSS staleness, sync.Once misuse, etc — without waiting for a 5min CI round trip. The remote CI then becomes a parallel validator + auto-deploy tool, not the primary gatekeeper.
- **Confirm live deployment by byte-diffing an embedded asset.** `diff <(curl https://<host>/static/<asset>) <(repo <asset>)` is the cheapest proof the running binary matches the latest commit. Use for any "is the fix actually live?" question.
- **`git stash drop` is destructive** — it removes the ref without applying. Use `git stash pop` (apply + remove) or, before any stash drop, snapshot working changes to a `wip-*` branch.
- **Heredoc commit/tag messages**: prefer `git commit -F - <<'EOF' ... EOF` (quoted EOF = literal body) or `git tag -F /tmp/msg`. Avoid `git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF' ... EOF)"` — bash quoting through the outer `"` + `$()` can fail parse on apostrophes/backticks in the body.

## Feedback loop (4 tiers, cheapest first)

Cascade up the tiers as confidence grows. Each tier catches a
different failure class; lower tiers are ~10x cheaper, so promote
only when (a) about to push/merge, or (b) the change touches an
area the next tier checks.

### T1 — format + build (~10s)

```bash
gofumpt -l -d <changed-files>   # format drift (<1s)
go build ./...                  # compile errors (~5-10s)
```

Catches formatting drift and compilation errors. Run every few
minutes during active editing. Replaces the old habit of running
`make build` repeatedly — `make build` only runs `go build`, not
formatting or lint, so it misses drift that T1 catches.

### T2 — lint + datastar + format + sizes + deadcode (~15-20s)

```bash
go vet ./...                                              # stdlib vet
golangci-lint run <changed-glob>                          # 27 linters, scoped
make templ && make datastar-lint                          # only when .templ changed
make fmt                                                  # gofumpt + goimports, full repo
make check-sizes && make deadcode                         # binary size + deadcode scan
```

Catches shadow, mnd, nolintlint, revive, staticcheck — same
config as CI but scoped to the packages you touched. ~15-20s for
scoped lint. Datastar-lint only applies to `.templ` changes;
sizes + deadcode + full-repo fmt catch the slow-moving drift.

**T2 must be green before T3.** Lint and format errors fail the
build downstream; running tests on a known-linted codebase saves
re-runs.

### T3 — scoped tests (~5-30s)

```bash
go test -race -count=1 -short <changed-glob>
```

Package-level only. `-race` catches data races. `-short` skips
long-running tests when present. Use after T2 is green on a
specific fix. The `-p 1` from `make test` is unnecessary at this
tier because DagNats FD starvation only matters when running ACROSS
packages.

### T4 — full pre-push gate (`make ci-local`, ~60-180s)

```bash
make ci-local
# templ + datastar-lint + css-check + golangci-lint +
# go test -race -p 1 ./... -count=1 + go build
```

The single source of truth for "is the gate green". Run right
before `git add` + `git push`. If this is green, push — the
remote CI runs the same gate plus deploy. Same checks as the
remote CI's lint job.

### T5 — local signoff (~60-180s, replaces waiting on CI)

```bash
make signoff
# = make ci-local + "gh signoff -f" stamp on HEAD
```

A advisory stamp saying "this commit has the same checks CI runs,
locally verified". After `make signoff` succeeds, you can push
without holding your breath for CI to discover a race or syntax
issue. The remote CI still runs the same gate as a parallel
validator and to drive the auto-deploy step — signoff does
**not** skip CI.

Why bother when CI also runs? Because each CI round trip is
~3–5min wall-clock waiting on queue + runners + remote logs —
cumulative across many small commits. `make signoff` catches
~95%% of issues (race detector on `TestXxx`, lint warnings,
format drift, CSS staleness, sync.Once wrong placement,
Dockerfile `ARG` inline placement, etc.) in that same 3min
window but locally, so you find them, fix them, re-signoff, push.

The order is: **commit locally → `make signoff` → `git push
origin master`**. If signoff green lights you, push is a
single-arg action, not a “hope CI likes it” gamble.

The remote CI is also the source of truth for **test execution**
in general — re-running the full test suite locally wastes time
that the parallel CI run is doing for you. Only re-run locally if
remote CI is broken or you're reproducing a CI-specific failure.

### Make check removed

`make check` was removed from the Makefile — it was a redundant
gate (subset of `make ci-local` without build verification). Use
`make ci-local` instead.

### Make target audit (what still earns its place)

| Target             | Status   | Why                                                                                  |
|--------------------|----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `make build`       | keep     | `go build` of the unified binary. The fast "is it compileable?" check.               |
| `make templ`       | keep     | Regenerates `_templ.go` from `.templ` source.                                       |
| `make css`         | keep     | Rebuilds `app.min.css` from `src/css/input.css`.                                     |
| `make css-check`   | keep     | Diff vs HEAD; fails ci-local if stale.                                               |
| `make datastar-lint` | keep   | Catches Datastar anti-patterns in `.templ`.                                           |
| `make fmt`         | keep     | Full-repo gofumpt + goimports (CI gate).                                             |
| `make lint`        | keep     | Full-repo vet + golangci-lint (used by `make check`-equivalent flows; slow).         |
| `make test`        | keep     | Race tests; the remote CI uses this directly.                                         |
| `make check-sizes` | keep     | Binary size budget check.                                                              |
| `make deadcode`    | keep     | Deadcode scan.                                                                        |
| `make ci-local`    | **canonical gate** | The pre-push gate. Replaces `make check`.                              |
| `make check`       | **removed** | Redundant subset of `ci-local`. Promote `ci-local`.                               |
| `make signoff`     | **promoted** | `ci-local` + `gh signoff` advisory stamp. Default pre-push gate; catches ~95%% of issues locally in <3min. |
| `make setup`       | keep     | Git hooks install.                                                                     |
| `make desktop`     | keep     | Wails v3 desktop shell.                                                              |
| `make dev`         | keep     | Air live reload.                                                                       |

### Anti-patterns (do not do this)

- **`make check`** — removed; use `make ci-local`.
- **`make test` between every commit** — same wall clock as
  `ci-local` minus the other checks. Use `ci-local` for the
  full pass; use T3 scoped `go test -race` for fast package
  feedback.
- **Skipping T1** — format drift piles up silently.
- **`golangci-lint run ./...`** (whole repo) for small changes —
  always scope to the changed packages (full-repo is ~10x
  slower).
- **Running the full test suite locally** when remote CI is
  healthy — same wall clock, but local fix-ups don't propagate.
- **Touching a class that isn't real CSS** (e.g. writing `p-1`
  in test data, JSON examples, or markdown prose) — Tailwind's
  content scanner reads `.templ`, `.go`, and via the
  `@import "tailwindcss" source(...)` directive, anything that
  matches the source globs. A `class="...p-1..."` accidentally
  emitted as a Tailwind utility creates spurious CSS in
  `app.min.css` and fails `css-check`. Run `make css` during T2
  for any change that might introduce class-shaped tokens.

```

**Three complementary async layers:** `goqite` (jobs+SSE) · `dagnats` (durable workflows) · `JetStream` (cross-instance realtime). They coexist in the same binary; all three are always compiled.

**Routing (read before touching `router.Init`):** PocketBase `RouterGroup` compiles to stdlib `http.ServeMux` (Go 1.22+ subtree matching — `GET /` swallows unregistered subpaths). Register all routes DIRECTLY on `se.Router` inside the OnServe hook (nested `OnServe().BindFunc` never fires). App cookie is `gogogo_auth` (NOT `pb_auth`) — the two cookies are intentional: PocketBase keeps admin (`_superusers`) and regular users as SEPARATE auth namespaces, so sharing `pb_auth` clobbers the admin session in the same browser (known PB gotcha, issues #5050/#1780). Run the admin UI on a separate origin/port (`:8090/_/`) so even `pb_auth` never collides. Serve static assets via EXACT `/static/<file>` routes (PB catch-all shadows wildcards). Full routing war-stories: see `ARCHITECTURE.md`.

## Realtime transport decision

**Todo records** (create/toggle/delete) flow through **PocketBase realtime** — the realtime SSE lives at `/api/realtime`, is authenticated by the app's `LoadAuthFromCookie` middleware (reads `gogogo_auth`), and the collection's `ListRule`/`ViewRule` (`@request.auth.id != '' && owner = @request.auth.id`) make delivery **per-user scoped**. Each subscribed client re-fetches `/api/todos/fragment` and morphs `#todo-list` on a `todos` event. This is the mechanism for DB actions — do NOT add a parallel SSE-hub re-render for todo mutations.

**The SSE hub (`/api/todos/stream`)** is reserved for **ephemeral signals only**: the live clients count, LLM suggest feedback, and DagNats workflow progress. It also carries the **originating client's** synchronous patch on its own mutation POST. It does NOT broadcast record mutations to other clients.

**Whiteboard** uses **SSEHub + NATS** — shapes are dual-broadcast: in-process via the SSE Hub (same-process tabs) and over NATS via the SyncWorker (cross-instance convergence). Presence cursors use the same SSE Hub with exclude-origin fan-out. Clients are **offline-first**: Loro CRDT merges late/replayed ops on reconnect (outbox in `whiteboard.js`).

**NATS JetStream** is used by DagNats (workflow engine state), the whiteboard SyncWorker (cross-instance doc sync), and the optional desktop-edge Leaf Node. The todo broadcaster uses an in-memory fan-out by default (can be wired to JetStream for multi-instance deployments).

## Local CI (gh-signoff) — T5 of the feedback loop

CI runs on push to `master` then deploys. Run the **same gate locally** to avoid broken pushes:

```bash
gh extension install basecamp/gh-signoff  # one-time
make signoff                              # ci-local + gh signoff -f
```

`make signoff` is T5 in the feedback loop (see above): it runs T4
(`ci-local`) and stamps HEAD as locally-verified. Once the stamp
is on the commit, the push is safe in the sense that "this code
builds, tests, lints, and matches CI". The remote CI then runs
the same checks as a parallel validator + drives the auto-deploy
step; signoff does not skip CI.

Uses golangci-lint (not standalone gofumpt) as the formatter
gate — gofumpt can be a newer release than golangci-lint
bundles, causing false positives. Signoff is **advisory**
(push-to-master flow, not PR merge) — do NOT `gh signoff
install`.

### Pre-push workflow: signoff local, then push

Remote CI + deploy is slow on every push to `master`. The chain
below turns a push from "hope CI likes it" into a confirmation:

1. Work locally, commit with `git commit -F /tmp/msg`.
2. `make signoff` (1–3min locally).
3. If it returns successfully, **push without asking**.
4. CI will validate in parallel and deploy on success.

Watch-outs across recent releases:

- Race detector on tests (e.g. v0.21.3 sync.Once fix) — caught
  by T3/T5, **not** by `make build`. Always run T5 before push.
- Dockerfile syntax (e.g. v0.21.4 inline-ARG bug) — the container
  build is what fails, not Go. T5 catches this only if `docker
  buildx build` is reachable locally; on Mac without the
  aarch64 toolchain, only CI catches it. The CHANGELOG pins
  when this hits.
- `go build -tags "<stale>"` (e.g. -tags jetstream dagnats after
  the unified-build era) silently succeeds — T2 shows nothing,
  T4 does nothing, T5 does nothing. CI does nothing. The
  `git push` succeeds but the runtime drift is silent. No
  catching mechanism today; review tags when editing startup
  comments.

## Deploy

Push-to-`master` triggers `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` (Tailscale OIDC + Docker to single server). Server layout/deploy-user/secret tables: see `/skill:cali-ops-deploy-github-tailscale`. Two gotchas: (1) grant container write via `setfacl`/`chmod`, NEVER `chown` (non-root deploy user); (2) never `scp` into the server's repo clone — `git pull --ff-only` aborts. Scratch image healthcheck: `CMD [\"/app\",\"health\"]` (no `wget`/`curl`/`CMD-SHELL`).

## DaisyUI

ALL HTML UI uses DaisyUI components (read https://daisyui.com/llms.txt). Load `/static/app.min.css` (built by `npm run build`, regenerated in Dockerfile). NEVER `daisyui.min.css` (v4 relic, breaks v5 markup).

## Key config constants (single source of truth)

| Constant | File | Default | Purpose |
|----------|------|---------|---------|
| `DefaultReplayBufferSize` | `config/config.go` | 64 | Per-client replay ring-buffer length |
| `DefaultClientQueueSize` | `config/config.go` | 64 | Per-client SSE channel buffer |
| `DefaultSSEHeartbeatInterval` | `config/config.go` | 15s | SSE heartbeat to detect disconnection |
| `OfflineSync.Enabled` | `config/config.go` | `true` (opt-out: `OFFLINE_SYNC_ENABLED=false`) | Toggle hybrid offline sync |

**One place for all configs:** `config/config.go`. Runtime constants that are package-specific (e.g. `DefaultBaseURL` in `internal/llm/goai.go`) stay cohesionated — but all env vars are documented in config.go's comment block.

## Removing features & tests by SCOPE

When you remove a feature or plugin component, tests come along naturally:

| If you remove… | Delete these packages | These test files go with them automatically |
|----------------|----------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Todo** (feature) | `features/todo/` | `features/todo/*_test.go` ✅ |
| **Whiteboard** (feature) | `features/whiteboard/` (including its `static/` subdir), `internal/collab/` | `features/whiteboard/*_test.go`, `internal/collab/*_test.go` ✅ |
| **DagNats** (plugin) | `internal/dagnats/`, `router/onboarding_dagnats.go` | `internal/dagnats/*_test.go`, `features/todo/onboarding_e2e_test.go` ⚠️ check cross-package deps |
| **NATS** (plugin) | `internal/nats/` | `internal/nats/*_test.go`, `internal/collab/*_test.go` ⚠️ collab may depend on NATS |
| **OfflineSync** (opt-out) | `config/config.go` (+ `sw.js`) | `internal/nats/crudproxy_test.go` ✅ (covers create/toggle/delete/clear_completed e2e with JetStream). Remove `sw.js` + SW registration from templ files + delete crudproxy.go |
| **LLM** (plugin) | `internal/llm/` | `internal/llm/*_test.go`, `features/todo/suggest_test.go` ⚠️ |
| **EntityStore** (plugin) | `features/store/pbstore/` | `features/store/pbstore/*_test.go` (future). Drop `todoH.SetStore(pbstore.New(app, "todos"))` from `router.Init`; the handler's lazy fallback (`h.st()` in `todo_repo.go`) will rebuild a PBStore on first use. Remove `features/store/pbstore/` to use a different strategy (e.g. the future CRDTStore). |
| **Idempotency** (plugin) | `db/idempotency_hook.go` + `db/idempotency_seed.go` | `db/idempotency_hook_test.go` ✅. Remove both files, drop `RegisterIdempotencyHook(app)` and `enableTodosIdempotency(col)` from `db/seed.go`, and remove the hidden `name="idem_key"` input from `createForm`. |

**Rule of thumb:** `go test ./...` after deleting a package. If a compilation error mentions the deleted package in a test file, delete that test file too. Cross-package tests (like `features/todo/onboarding_e2e_test.go` depending on `internal/dagnats`) will fail to compile — that's your checklist.

## Desktop builds

```bash
# One-time: install Wails v3 CLI
# go install github.com/wailsapp/wails/v3/cmd/wails@latest

# Build for current platform
./scripts/desktop-build.sh

# Build Android APK (requires SDK + NDK + JDK 21)
./scripts/desktop-build.sh android

# Build macOS .app bundle
./scripts/desktop-build.sh package
```

The desktop binary shares 100% of the backend. With `NATS_LEAFNODE_URL` set, it becomes a NATS Leaf Node syncing JetStream with the server (offline edits replay on reconnect). See `scripts/desktop-build.sh` for full docs.

## Testing

Temp-dir PocketBase + Bootstrap + real SQLite; `httptest.NewServer` over a real router; assert against DB. LLM fakes via `internal/llm/fakeserver` (transport) or injected stubs (business logic). `go test -race -p 1 ./...` (serialized packages for DagNats engine stability).

  to a commit message, PR description, release notes, blog post, or
  CHANGELOG entry. The model did not co-author; the trailer falsely
  credits it.
- **Never** add an explicit human `Co-Authored-By` trailer to release
  notes either — release notes are part of the artifact, not
  meta-commentary.
- When drafting a `/tmp/msg.txt` (commit message) or
  `/tmp/notes.txt` (release body), the file ends at the last
  meaningful sentence. Do not append attribution lines.

**Why this matters:** the trailer would spread AI crediting into
commit history and release pages where every reader of the public
repo sees it. The model has no standing to claim co-authorship of a
release the user did not design, edit, and approve end-to-end.
