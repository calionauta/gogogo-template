# gogogo-fullstack-template

> Full-stack Go web application template — back-end + front-end + DB + auth + LLM + deploy, all in one binary.

## Project Overview

Go web application template with Datastar + Templ + PocketBase + goqite + Turbine + NATS JetStream.
Module: `github.com/calionauta/gogogo-fullstack-template`

**Naming convention.** The repository, module path, Go binary, deployment
directory (`/home/deploy/<APP_NAME>/`), Docker container name and
Cloudflare Tunnel hostname all share the same project name. When you clone
this template, replace `gogogo-fullstack-template` with your own snake-case
project name everywhere (or run a one-shot search-and-replace over the tree).

## Stack

Go 1.26 | Templ v0.3.1020 | Datastar v1.2.2 (datastar-go) | PocketBase v0.39.5 (embedded, ncruces/go-sqlite3) | TailwindCSS v4.1.13 (CLI build) + DaisyUI v5.6.15 | goqite v0.4.0 | retry-go v4 | Turbine v0.3.0 (opt-in, build tag) | NATS JetStream (opt-in, build tag) | age v1.3.1 | uuid v1.6.0

## DaisyUI Components

For ALL HTML UI, use DaisyUI components. Read https://daisyui.com/llms.txt before building any UI.

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `make dev` | Live reload with Air (post-build: gofumpt + go vet + golangci-lint info) |
| `make build` / `build-jetstream` / `build-turbine` / `build-all` | Build binary with optional tags |
| `make test` / `test-jetstream` / `test-turbine` | Run tests with race detector |
| `make templ` | Generate Templ components |
| `make fmt` | Check formatting (gofumpt + goimports) |
| `make datastar-lint` | Lint `.templ` / `.html` via [datastar-lint](https://github.com/calionauta/datastar-lint) |
| `make check` | **Full gate**: fmt + datastar-lint + golangci-lint (no `--fast`) + vet + sizes + deadcode + race tests |
| `make setup` | Install blocking pre-commit + pre-push hooks |
| `bin/datastar-lint` | Wrapper that installs and runs datastar-lint (also wired into `make check`) |

## Don'ts

- Do NOT use HTMX/Alpine.js — use Datastar
- Do NOT use `fmt.Sprintf` for HTML — use Templ
- Do NOT remove goqite when adding JetStream (they are complementary)
- Do NOT use modernc.org/sqlite — driver is ncruces/go-sqlite3
- Do NOT use raw CSS class names when a DaisyUI component exists
- Do NOT use `log` package — use `log/slog` (stdlib since Go 1.21)
- Do NOT manually set the `id` field on a PocketBase record (PK Max=15, Pattern=^[a-z0-9]+$)
- Do NOT call the real LLM in tests — use a fake. Two layers of faking:
  - **Business logic** (parsing, retry, error handling): inject a function field or `LLMClient` interface with a stub. Zero network, fast.
  - **Transport** (wire format, auth header, SSE streaming, net timeouts): use `internal/llm/fakeserver` — a real `httptest.Server` speaking the OpenAI `/v1/chat/completions` slice. Only for tests inside `internal/llm/` itself; consumers use function-field injection.

## Testing LLM

The project ships `internal/llm/fakeserver` — a fake OpenAI Chat Completions server for end-to-end tests of the GoAI transport layer **without real tokens or network egress**.

Use it when testing `internal/llm` itself (the client, retries, streaming, timeouts). For features that *call* the LLM (e.g. `features/todo`), inject a stub via function-field — do NOT spin up `httptest` in feature tests.

```go
srv := fakeserver.New(t, fakeserver.WithResponse("hello"))
defer srv.Close()
t.Setenv("GOAI_BASE_URL", srv.URL)
c := llm.New("test-key")
out, _ := c.Chat(ctx, "ignored")
// out == "hello"; srv.CallCount() == 1
```

Options: `WithResponse`, `WithStreamChunks`, `WithStatusSequence` (retry tests), `WithResponseDelay` (timeout tests), `WithAPIKey` (auth tests). All variants preserve RGBA/transparency-safe behavior. See `internal/llm/fakeserver/fakeserver_test.go` for the full pattern.

## Architecture

```
cmd/web/                  Entry point (PB + goqite + SSE Hub). Builds: jetstream | turbine (opt-in).
config/                   Env-based config
db/                       PocketBase setup + ensureTodosCollection seed
internal/{secrets,queue,nats,workflow,llm,datastar}/
features/app/             Application core: AppContext + cross-cutting middleware
features/todo/            Example: Todo MVC (Datastar + DaisyUI + PocketBase + SSE Hub)
web/resources/            Static assets (embedded)
```

### Wiring HTTP routes — read this before touching `router.Init` or `RegisterAuth`

PocketBase exposes a `RouterGroup` API that looks like a router, but on
`BuildMux()` it compiles down to **Go stdlib `http.ServeMux`** (see
`tools/router/router.go:73` in the PBase vendored source). Two things
this implies:

1. **`http.ServeMux` Go 1.22+ matches `"GET /"` as a subtree** — it
   intercepts any `GET /<sub>` that has no more specific pattern
   registered. Order of registration doesn't matter (specificity wins).
   So registering `GET /` for the index handler will swallow
   `GET /random/path` until you register a more specific pattern.
2. **`Hook.Trigger` snapshots handlers before running them.** If you
   call `app.OnServe().BindFunc(...)` from inside another `OnServe`
   handler (nested hook), the inner Bind never fires — the snapshot
   has already been taken. This bit us in commit `c3b15a9`: a nested
   `auth.RegisterAuth` looked like it registered `/login` and `/logout`
   but they were silently missing, so `GET /login` fell through to
   `GET /` and produced a 303 loop.

**Rules**

- Register all routes DIRECTLY on `se.Router` inside the existing
  router.OnServe hook — no nested `app.OnServe().BindFunc`. If you need
  middleware that runs on every route, register it via
  `se.Router.BindFunc(...)` BEFORE adding routes (e.g. the global
  `auth.LoadAuthFromCookie` middleware is wired this way in
  `router.Init` — `e.Auth` is nil on every request otherwise and custom
  routes bounce to `/login`).
- **PocketBase installs a catch-all dashboard route
  (`e.Router.GET("/{path...}", apis.Static(...))`, see
  `apis/base.go`) that requires superuser auth and redirects
  unauthenticated requests to `/login`. That catch-all SHADOWS any
  wildcard route you register (e.g. `/static/*`) — the handler is
  never reached, so every `/static/*` request 303-redirects to `/login`
  and the browser chokes on the HTML when it expected CSS/JS.** Echo
  gives EXACT routes the highest priority, so serve embedded static
  assets via one EXACT route per file (walk the embedded FS in
  `router.Init`), not a wildcard. Proven fix: `router.go` registers
  `/static/<file>` exactly.
- Group middlewares (`se.Router.BindFunc(...)`) are concatenated into
  every route by `loadMux` regardless of registration order. Order
  inside the chain comes from the order of `BindFunc` calls on the
  router group.
- `se.Router.GET("/")` is fine for the index but remember it will match
  every other `GET` you haven't explicitly registered. Verify with
  `curl -sI http://localhost:8080/<path>` for each new route.
- When debugging routing, add `os.Stderr.WriteString` (NOT `slog.Info`,
  because PocketBase's logger is batch-buffered and only flushes every
  3 seconds) at the top of handler/middleware to see what actually runs.

```

Three async layers (complementary, not alternatives):
`goqite` → background jobs + SSE; `turbine` → durable workflows; `JetStream` → multi-user real-time.

### PocketBase admin UI

PocketBase ships a full admin UI (data browser, REST playground, superuser, backups, file storage) on the same port at **`/_/`** — no extra service, no extra auth to wire. In production, lock it down with PocketBase's own superuser auth + (optionally) an IP allowlist or oauth2-proxy in front. See `docs/decisions.md` for the deployment choices.

## Build tags (`goqite` is core, the others are opt-in)

The default build (`go build ./cmd/web`) is the recommended starting point for almost every project. It ships the full UI, the queue, the SSE Hub, the LLM client, the auth feature, and the demo Todo app. The only async layer that's gated is `goqite` itself being **always on** — the others are opt-in heavyweight features:

| Build tag | Binary size impact | What you get | Where it's wired |
|---|---|---|---|
| _(default)_ | baseline | `goqite` queue + `InMemoryBroadcaster` (single-process cross-client SSE) + demo Todo app + auth + LLM | `router/router.go` |
| `-tags jetstream` | +9 MB | Above + an embedded NATS server + durable `TODOS` JetStream stream for multi-instance realtime | `cmd/web/nats.go` (`//go:build jetstream`) + `cmd/web/nats_noop.go` (`//go:build !jetstream`) |
| `-tags turbine` | +2 MB | Above + durable multi-step workflows (e.g. `WelcomeOnboarding`) and the Turbine executor in PocketBase SQLite | `cmd/web/turbine.go` + `cmd/web/turbine_noop.go` |
| `-tags "jetstream turbine"` | +11 MB | Both opt-ins stacked | sum of the above |

The build-tag pattern is **file-level** in `cmd/web/`. Each tag has a noop stub (e.g. `turbine_noop.go`) so the default build never references the heavy deps. The router checks `cfg.NATS.Enabled` / `cfg.Turbine` runtime flags to decide whether to call the wiring functions; feature handlers (`features/todo/handlers/admin.go`, `.../onboarding.go`) gate their behaviour on `h.llm != nil && h.llm.Configured()` and the cfg flags, so routes 404 cleanly when features are off rather than crash.

When adding a new feature with an optional dependency, follow the same shape: `internal/feature/<name>.go` (real impl) + `internal/feature/<name>_noop.go` (default build stub) + a `cfg.<Name>.Enabled` flag. See `docs/decisions.md` for the rationale.

## Cross-cutting application core

`features/app/` provides `AppContext` — a single struct that bundles
the cross-cutting dependencies every feature might need (queue, LLM
client, config). The template itself uses it lightly (mainly for
`LogStartupSummary`), but downstream projects that grow to multiple
features can wire their handlers to take `*AppContext` instead of
assembling (queue, llm, broadcaster, ...) individually. See the
package doc in `features/app/app.go` for the full rationale.

## Quality Gate

Run `make check` after each significant edit. The pre-commit hook (`make setup`) is blocking on the same gate. Pre-push adds `govulncheck`. See `docs/decisions.md` for the why.

## Realtime (todo sharing across clients)

Cross-client todo mutations go through `nats.TodoBroadcaster` (wired in `router.Init`). See the "Build tags" table above for the runtime vs JetStream trade-off. The `features/todo/handlers/todo.go` `broadcastTodo()` helper is the single chokepoint: it goes through `h.broadcaster` (the broadcaster field) and is silently skipped if `nil`. So a feature handler doesn't need to know whether the deployment is single-instance or multi-instance — it just calls `broadcastTodo()`.

## LLM Integration (GoAI)

`internal/llm` wraps GoAI behind an injectable interface. Tests must NOT call the real provider — inject a fake (or VCR replay). Streaming modeled as an iterator so backpressure/cancel are testable.

## Deploy

Production deploys to a single server (Hetzner / any VPS) via Tailscale + Cloudflare Tunnel. Triggered by `push to master` (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`). Manual deploys also work: `bash scripts/deploy-prod.sh` on the server after the binary is scp'd into place.

### One-time server setup

The project assumes the canonical layout under `/home/deploy/<app>/`:

```
/home/deploy/gogogo-fullstack-template/
  bin/         gogogo-fullstack-template (replaced atomically on every deploy)
  compose/     docker-compose.prod.yml (also replaced on every deploy)
  secrets/     gogogo-fullstack-template.env (mode 0600, regenerated from GH Secrets)
  data/        SQLite bind-mount dir (persistent). Owned by the
              `deploy` user; the container runs as uid 65532 and gets
              rwx via `setfacl -R -m u:65532:rwx -d -m u:65532:rwx`
              (or `chmod -R 0777` fallback) applied in
              `scripts/deploy-prod.sh`. NEVER `chown 65532:65532` — the
              deploy user is non-root and that fails, crashing the
              container with `sqlite3: permission denied`.

> **Deploy permission gotcha (cost a CI run).** The `deploy` user has
> no passwordless sudo and cannot `chown`/`mkdir` under `/var/lib`
> (root-owned). Keep the data dir under `/home/deploy` and grant the
> container write access with `setfacl`/`chmod`, never `chown`. Also:
> the GitHub Action does `git -C <repo> pull --ff-only` in its
> "Ensure layout" step — so **never `scp` edited files into the server's
> repo clone** (`/home/deploy/<app>/repo`); it dirties the tree and the
> `git pull` aborts, failing the whole deploy. Push to `master` instead.
> See PLAN.md Bug #7.```

The `deploy` user (no passwordless sudo) owns the layout. `/home/deploy` is writable; `/opt` is root-owned and not used. If you already have a project at a different path, `APP_DIR` in `scripts/deploy-prod.sh` is the only constant to change.

### One-time GitHub Actions secrets

| Secret | Where to get it |
|---|---|
| `TS_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` | [login.tailscale.com/admin/settings/identity](https://login.tailscale.com/admin/settings/identity) → New federated identity. Issuer: GitHub. Audience: anything memorable (e.g. `ts-actions-deploy`). Copy the **Client ID** (not a secret). Make sure the federated identity is scoped to the tag you'll use (e.g. `tag:continuous-integration`). |
| `TS_AUDIENCE` | Same page as the client ID — the **Audience** value you chose. |
| `DEPLOY_HOST` | The Tailscale hostname or `100.x.x.x` Tailscale IP of the server. Must be reachable from the GH runner (which is on a Tailscale net for the duration of the job). **Port 2222** is used (not 22): that's the Tailscale SSH userspace port since Tailscale 1.32 — separate from local sshd on port 22. The workflow's `~/.ssh/config` already sets `Port 2222`. |
| `DEPLOY_USER` | The SSH user on the server (e.g. `deploy`). Must be in the Tailscale ACL allowing SSH from the runner. |
| `DEPLOY_SSH_KEY` | The private SSH key (PEM). The corresponding public key goes in `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` on the server. |
| `GOAI_API_KEY` | Any OpenAI-compatible key (Groq, OpenAI, OpenRouter). |
| `ADMIN_UNLOCK_TOKEN` | `openssl rand -hex 32` (or empty to disable the custom admin panel). |

**No `TS_OAUTH_SECRET`** — unlike the older OAuth-client flow, OIDC federated identities don't need a static secret. The runner mints a short-lived JWT signed by GitHub Actions; Tailscale verifies it via the `aud` claim. Recommended by Tailscale over OAuth clients. See [Workload identity federation](https://tailscale.com/docs/features/workload-identity-federation).

If `TS_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` or `TS_AUDIENCE` are missing, the deploy job fails at the "Bring up Tailscale" step. The workflow is structured so any missing secret causes a fast, named failure (not a silent hang).

### Adding a new sub-domain (Cloudflare Tunnel)

The Tunnel ID + config file live at `~/.tunnel-config.json` on the server. To add a new ingress rule (e.g. `staging.fullstack.example.com`):

1. Append the new hostname + service to `~/.tunnel-config.json` (the `404` catch-all must stay last).
2. `bash ~/bin/update-tunnel.sh` (reads `~/.secrets/cloudflare.env`, calls the Cloudflare API).
3. Add the DNS CNAME: `bash ~/bin/cloudflare-dns.sh add <name> <TUNNEL_ID>.cfargotunnel.com` (or use the `upsert` form if available).

Both scripts use the user's `~/bin/` convention (`set -a; source ~/.secrets/cloudflare.env; set +a`) and never hardcode tokens. See `docs/decisions.md` for the full rationale.

## Linting

The project layers three linters, all wired into `make check`:

| Linter | What it catches | Repo / docs |
|--------|----------------|-------------|
| [gofumpt](https://github.com/mvdan/gofumpt) + [goimports](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/cmd/goimports) | Stricter `gofmt` (added grouping, alignment, no leading zero in decimals) + import grouping | `make fmt` |
| [golangci-lint v2.12.2](https://golangci-lint.run) | errcheck, govet, staticcheck, lll, gosec, gocritic, gocyclo, noctx, ... | `make lint` |
| [datastar-lint](https://github.com/calionauta/datastar-lint) | Data-attribute shape, signal/expression validity, SSE handler patterns, missing `data-on`, etc. — the Datastar analog of `eslint-plugin-datastar` | `make datastar-lint` |

`make check` runs all three. `make setup` installs blocking pre-commit + pre-push hooks on the same gate (pre-push adds `govulncheck`).

When adding a new `.templ` file, run `make datastar-lint` locally before pushing — it catches attribute errors that won't surface until runtime.

## Testing

Pattern: temp-dir PocketBase + Bootstrap + real SQLite (no mocks), `httptest.NewServer` over a real router, assert against the database.
