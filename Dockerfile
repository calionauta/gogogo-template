# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1.7

# Multi-stage build (maximo lean):
#   1. builder  — golang:1.26-alpine + nodejs/npm. Runs the Tailwind v4
#                  + DaisyUI v5 CSS build, generates Templ, compiles
#                  the Go binary (CGO_ENABLED=0 + static + stripped).
#   2. runtime  — scratch. The runtime image contains ONLY:
#                    - /app         (the 30 MB static binary)
#                    - /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt (for HTTPS to
#                      LLM providers, fetched in the builder)
#                    - /tmp         (writable; Go runtime expects it)
#                  No shell, no libc, no /etc/passwd, no package manager.
#                  Total image size: ~30 MB (binary + ca-bundle).
#
# We do NOT use gcr.io/distroless/static-debian12 because it adds a
# ~2 MB base that scratch eliminates. Scratch is the leanest viable
# base for a static Go binary; the only thing it lacks is /etc/passwd
# and a writable /tmp, both of which we explicitly handle below
# (USER 65532 and mkdir /tmp). ca-certificates is the only library
# asset we need to ship because Go's net/http uses it for TLS.
#
# Build pipeline (Makefile 'css' target) + this Dockerfile are the
# only two compile steps. No JS runtime in the final image.

# the builder, then this layer sets the perms. Alternative: use a
# multi-stage copy with --chown. We do not use --chown because the
# base has no user to own with.
