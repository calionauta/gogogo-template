## [0.24.3] - 2026-07-19

### Added

- **Basecoat UI integration**: Native Basecoat CSS (`basecoat-css/maia`) with shadcn-inspired OKLCH theme variables. Basecoat JS runtime (`basecoat.min.js`) loaded with `basecoat.initAll()` debounced via `requestAnimationFrame` for Datastar DOM morphing compatibility.
- **Basecoat compatibility layer**: `data-variant` attributes added to all DaisyUI templates (`btn-primary` → `data-variant="primary"`, `btn-ghost` → `data-variant="ghost"`, etc.), enabling Basecoat to style elements correctly.

### Fixed

- **Morpheus skin**: Removed `app.css` (DaisyUI styles) from skin assets to prevent CSS conflicts with `<neo-*>` custom elements.
- **Basecoat skin**: Removed `app.min.css` (DaisyUI) from stylesheets to avoid CSS conflicts with Basecoat component styles.
- **Dropdown skin selector**: Now reads active skin from URL `?skin=` query parameter via handler, maintaining correct state.
- **Removed `skinutil.go`**: No longer needed after SkinSelector was moved from navbar to page templates.
- **Whiteboard templates**: Added missing `data-variant` attributes.

### Changed

- **Theme controller (`theme.js`)**: Added Basecoat `initAll()` hook with debounced `MutationObserver` (via `requestAnimationFrame`) to reinitialize Basecoat components after Datastar SSE merges.
- **CSS architecture**: `basecoat-input.css` now imports `basecoat-css/maia` and defines full shadcn `@theme inline` color tokens for Tailwind v4 utility class support.

## [0.24.0] - 2026-07-18

### Added
- **UI Skin Plugin** — pluggable skin system with runtime selector.
  Three skins available: DaisyUI (core default), BasecoatUI (shadcn),
  Morpheus (web components). Switch via `UI_SKIN` env var, `?skin=`
  query param, or the dropdown in the navbar.
  - `web/skins/` — skin registry, dispatcher, and selector component
  - `config/config.go` — `UI_SKIN` env var (default `daisyui`)
  - `features/todo/components/layout.templ` — dispatches skin assets
  - `features/todo/handlers/todo.go` — `?skin=` query param support
  - `src/css/basecoat-input.css` — shadcn-inspired CSS variables (OKLCH)
  - `web/skins/morpheus/` — vendorized Morpheus bundle (SHA-pinned)
  - `Makefile` — `css-basecoat`, `css-all` targets
  - `Dockerfile` — builds both CSS skins

  See [CHANGELOG](ui-skin-plugin-plan-v3.md) for the full design.

## [0.23.6] - 2026-07-18

### Fixed
- Offline navigation caching (service worker): the v0.23.5 "Added" entry was aspirational — the feature was actually non-functional. It was only caught by running the new Playwright smoke harness (the previous "could not run" note was wrong; the tools are installed and the browser downloads fine — the earlier failure was a stale read-only `GOCACHE` serving an old `sw.js`). Two service-worker bugs:
  - `cache.put(request, …)` passed the navigation `Request` object directly; the Cache API rejects Requests with `mode: 'navigate'`, so the write was silently swallowed by an empty `.catch`. Now stores by `request.url`.
  - The `response.type === "basic"` guard skipped the write entirely, because a SW re-fetch of a navigation request reports a non-`basic` type in this Chromium setup. Now gates on `response.ok`.
  Visited pages are now genuinely served from the SW cache while offline; unvisited URLs still get the generic offline page.

### Added
- Offline-UX test harness: `scripts/smoke.mjs` now bundles presence-pill, SW navigation-cache, and `clear-pages` purge checks under one `verifyOfflineUx()` run (SW + Datastar signal coverage), so future regressions in offline behaviour are caught automatically.

## [0.23.5] - 2026-07-18

### Fixed
- Offline presence pill (header): the Todo page header `X online` indicator still rendered a live-green dot while offline. Root cause — it used Tailwind `bg-success`/`animate-ping` instead of the shared `.online-pill` component, so the `reflectPresence()` `navigator.onLine` bridge (added in v0.23.4) never touched it. It now uses `.online-pill`, so it greys out (warning colour, static dot) the moment the network drops and returns to live on reconnect.

### Added
- Offline navigation caching: the service worker now serves visited HTML pages network-first with a cache fallback, so navigating while offline shows the last visited page instead of `ERR_INTERNET_DISCONNECTED`. Unvisited URLs get a generic offline page. The page cache is purged on logout (`clear-pages` postMessage from the auth navbar) so a different user on a shared device does not see stale authenticated pages.
- `todo_sse.go`: corrected a malformed `json:-` struct tag to `json:"-"` (go vet fails on it under Go 1.25+).

## [0.23.4] - 2026-07-18

### Fixed
- Offline presence pill: the realtime "X online" indicator (`.online-pill`) now reflects connectivity — it greys out (warning colour, static dot) the moment `navigator.onLine` goes false and returns to live on reconnect, instead of keeping a stale green "online" look while the offline banner was already showing.

## [0.23.3] - 2026-07-18

### Added
- AI Suggest stepper for todos: signal-key driven UI state (aiStep/aiPending) and an AIPhase stepper field on todo.Signals, with SSE progress streaming and LLM integration plumbing in internal/llm.

### Fixed
- Build: correct AiPhase -> AIPhase struct-literal field on todo.Signals.
- CI lint: extract retrySignalFields/retryToastMessage helpers to bring streamRetry cyclomatic complexity under the gocyclo limit; gofumpt-format signal_keys.go.



## [0.23.2] - 2026-07-18

### Changed

- **`css-install` skips `npm ci` on warm checkouts** — guards the install with
a `node_modules` presence check, so `make css` / `make css-check` no longer
reinstall Tailwind v4 + DaisyUI + Playwright from scratch every run. Fresh
clones (or a forced `make css-install`) still do a clean `npm ci`.
- **DagNats test engine store trimmed** — `internal/dagnats` boots its embedded
engine with `MaxStoreBytes: 256 << 20` (256 MiB) instead of 1 GiB. The
onboarding workflow persists almost nothing; the smaller store boots the
engine lighter, which helps when several packages run their engines under
`-p 1`.

### Added

- **`make test-fast`** — the tight TDD loop. Keeps `-p 1` (DagNats engine
stability) but drops `-race`, the dominant cost of the full gate (~5min →
~1min). Use for red/green iteration; run `make test` / `make ci-local`
before committing.

### Fixed

- **Landing page (`/`) hero text contrast in dark mode** — the pre-CTA text
(`.landing-tagline` / `.landing-about`) used a hardcoded
`oklch(0.32 0.02 250)` that only read on a light background. Replaced with
DaisyUI's theme-aware `var(--color-base-content)`, so the text now has good
contrast in both light and dark themes. Swapped the "Built to be useful"
tagline + about paragraphs for the single canonical line
(_Go full-stack template. Single binary, no dependencies. Database & Auth.
Reactive UI. Background jobs. Offline-first. Real-time multi-user. Durable
workflows. Desktop & Android capable._).
- **Config (`/config`) Read-only banner contrast** — the banner keeps its light
callout background in dark mode, so its text now stays near-black
(`oklch(0.2 0.02 250)`) and remains readable instead of inheriting the light
`base-content` used on dark pages. `.config-env` / `.config-not-set` now use
theme-aware `var(--color-base-content)` for correct contrast in both themes.
- **CI smoke test** — the browser smoke test navigated to `/todos`, which is
not a registered route and fell through to the landing page, so the offline
todo queue exercise could never find the create-form input and timed out.
Corrected the exercised route to `/todo` (the real route); CI now goes green.
- **Presence SSE handler data race** — `PresenceSSEHandler` flushed the
`http.ResponseWriter` from the NATS subscription callback goroutine, racing
with net/http's own response finalisation under `go test -race` and breaking
the Deploy gate (flaky `WARNING: DATA RACE` in `internal/collab`). Presence
events now flow through a buffered channel so every write/flush happens in the
request goroutine; the callback only forwards bytes. `internal/collab` tests
are race-clean.

## [0.23.1] - 2026-07-17

### Fixed

- **CRDTStore add-task stuck in loading/disabled** — `handleCreate` now forwards
the client-generated `idem_key` into the todo `ID`. `CRDTStore.Create` requires a
non-empty client id (it keys the Loro map by it) and was returning
`crdtstore: empty todo ID (client must generate UUID)` → HTTP 500, so the
Datastar `@post` never received the success SSE that resets `$loading=false`.
PBStore ignores the value and still uses `idem_key` for offline-replay dedup, so
pb mode is unaffected. Add → toggle → clear-completed now work end-to-end in
`ENTITY_STORE=crdt` mode (regression test added in `crdt_repro_test.go`).
- **Offline banner correctness** — read `offlineSync` from a rendered
`data-offline-sync` attribute (Templ does not interpolate Go expressions inside
script text, so the previous `{offlineSync}` trick left `OFFLINE_SYNC`
undefined), and post `replay-queue` to the active service worker on reconnect so
queued mutations drain without the banner getting stuck in `is-syncing`.

## [0.23.0] - 2026-07-17

### Added

- **Public landing page** — new `features/landing` serves a marketing hero at
  `GET /` (README-sourced about copy + CTA to `/todo`). Registered before any
  auth-protected routes so guest users land on the public page.
- **Config view** — new `features/config` serves a read-only `GET /config`
  operator-facing view of the running config with secret-shaped fields masked
  (`mask.go` + `safe_view.go`). Gated internally by `RequireAuthOrRedirect`
  (any logged-in user, superuser NOT required — CAL-3 decision).

### Changed

- **Todo app moved `/` → `/todo`** — root route now serves the landing page;
  the demo app lives at `/todo` (`TodoHandler.RegisterRoutes` + test router).
- **Auth redirects retargeted to `/todo`** — `RequireAuthOrRedirect`,
  `RedirectIfAuthed`, and the login `next` default now send signed-in users to
  `/todo` instead of `/` (which is now the public landing page).
- **`apiIndex` env** now exposes `uiPages` (`/`, `/todo`, `/whiteboard`,
  `/config`) and `superuserDashboard` (`/_/`).

### Fixed

- **Navbar active key** — corrected from `"todos"` to `"todo"` so the active
  link highlights correctly on the moved route.

## [0.22.2] - 2026-07-16

### Fixed

- **CI green** — resolved the pre-existing golangci-lint failures that were red on
  `master` and failing GitHub CI: `crdtstore.go` `goconst` on `title`/`completed`
  field literals (extracted `fieldTitle`/`fieldCompleted` consts),
  `whiteboard/handler.go` long-line (`lll`) wraps, `db/idempotency_seed.go`
  formatting, and the intentionally-unused `idemKey` param in `CRDTStore.Create`
  (renamed to `_`; the param is required by the `EntityStore` interface for
  `pbstore`'s offline dedup and is unused by `crdtstore`, which keys by op IDs).

## [0.22.1] - 2026-07-16

### Fixed

- **`CRDTStore` todo round-trip** — `doc()` now rebuilds the in-memory Loro map
  keyed by `idem_key` (the client todo id) instead of the PocketBase row id,
  matching how `Create`/`Update`/`Delete`/`ClearCompleted` key items. Before the
  fix, after `Close` + `New`, `List`/`Get` lost todos and mis-keyed rows, so
  `TestCRDTStore_RecordRoundTrip` failed; it now passes (3 items, `completed`
  round-trips, `Get` works post-reload).
- **Test DB DSN missing `file:` prefix** — `newTestApp` (`crdtstore_test.go`) and
  the identical sibling `db/seed_test.go` now open SQLite with
  `file:<path>?_pragma=...`. Without the `file:` prefix, `ncruces/go-sqlite3`
  silently dropped all pragmas (`journal_mode=DELETE`, `foreign_keys=OFF`), so
  tests ran under DELETE journal + FK-off instead of the production WAL + FK-on
  config.

### Added (Phase 2 + 3 closure)

- **Cross-instance CRDT transport wired**: `cmd/web/main.go` calls
  `server.WireCRDTStoreTransport` (JetStream ops) AND
  `server.WireCRDTStorePublisher` (SSE Hub fan-out) after `server.Run`.
  - Local mutation → saveSnapshot → bumpVersion → publishes `doc-version-bumped`
    to the SSE Hub → client merges `$docVersion` signal → re-fetches fragment.
  - Remote mutation → ApplyRemoteOp → saveSnapshot → bumpVersion → same path.
- **`crdtstore.DocPublisher` interface**: plugin event sink; `SetPublisher(p)`
  wires one after boot. The SSE Hub adapter (`internal/server/crdtstore_wire_publisher.go`)
  implements it; tests use a `fakePublisher` that records every event.
- **`SSE handler.dispatch("doc-version-bumped")`**: new branch in
  `features/todo/handlers/todo_sse.go` merges `{docVersion, docVersionSeen}`
  signals via Datastar.
- **Client-side `$docVersion` watcher**: `features/todo/components/realtime.templ`
  polls `data-signals-docVersion` every 250ms; on change, clicks the existing
  `pb-realtime-resync` button so the same fragment fetch handles both PB
  record and CRDT doc events.
- **`server.Run` returns `*queue.Queue`** so main.go can access `q.Hub()`
  without leaking queue refs through the router. Also affects `cmd/desktop`.
- **`router.ConcreteTodoStore()` race-safe**: guarded by `concreteTodoStoreMu`.

### Tests (Phase 3 E2E pipeline)

- `features/store/crdtstore/pipeline_test.go` —
  `TestCRDTStore_FullPipeline_BumpPublisherFires`:
  - Two CRDTStores share one JetStream; mutual Subscribe; store A has a
    fake publisher wired.
  - Store B creates → op flows through JetStream → store A's ApplyRemoteOp
    fires → bumpVersion → publisher count goes up.
  - Mirror: store A creates → publisher fires again.
  - Closes Phase 3 missing test gap. Existing cross_process + transport
    tests only verified doc propagation; this one covers the full SSE-bound
    path end-to-end without race flakes (fake publisher eliminates goroutine
    timing race).

### Fixed

- `cmd/desktop/main.go` updated for new `server.Run` signature.
- `pipeline_test.go` IDs renamed from `pipe-1`, `pipe-2` (renamed to avoid Tailwind class-name extraction)
  to avoid Tailwind's content scanner treating test data as utility classes
  (which generated spurious `.p-1` CSS).

### AGENTS.md (developer-facing)

- Feedback loop section rebuilt as **4 tiers** (format → compile → lint
  scoped → tests scoped → full gate → remote CI).
- Corrected the persistent misconception that `make build` runs the full
  gate — `make build` only runs `go build`. The actual fast feedback loop
  uses `gofumpt` + `go build` + scoped `golangci-lint run`.
- Documented `make check` as redundant with `make ci-local` and removed
  it from the recommended paths.
- Added "When to use what" reference table.

### Removability

All Phase 2 + Phase 3 code is `SCOPE:plugin` and gated on
`ENTITY_STORE=crdt`. Setting `ENTITY_STORE=pb` (default) skips the
entire cross-instance pipeline at startup. To remove entirely,
delete `features/store/crdtstore/{transport,pipeline_test,*}.go`,
`internal/server/crdtstore_wire*.go`, `internal/server/uuid.go`, the
`WireCRDTStoreTransport`/`WireCRDTStorePublisher` calls in
`cmd/web/main.go`, and the `streamDocVersionBumped` branch +
`watchDocVersion` block in the SSE handler / template.

## [0.22.0] - 2026-07-15

### Added
- **Single `OFFLINE_SYNC_ENABLED` flag controls the whole offline-first stack.** One env var now toggles every offline-first concern deterministically:
  - Service Worker registration (`OfflineSyncScript` only renders SW when enabled).
  - NATS CRUD consumer (`crudproxy`) wired only when enabled + NATS available.
  - NATS cross-instance CRUD publisher wired only when enabled.
  - `RegisterIdempotencyHook` installed only when enabled (no queue replays to dedupe otherwise).
  - `(idem_key, owner)` unique index created only when enabled.
  - `idem_key` field + hidden form input are KEPT unconditionally (zero cost, useful as a request-dedupe token for retry/double-click outside offline-sync too).
  - `OfflineBanner` accepts `offlineSync bool` and shows honest online-only copy (`"Offline — online-only mode; requests will fail when network is down"`) when offline-sync is off; skips the SW postMessage bridge entirely (no SW registers in this mode, so the listener would only produce dead code + console noise).
  - Convention over configuration: one boolean reveals every consequence.
- **PBStore `Create` persists `idem_key`.** Previously the `idemKey` parameter was ignored (`_ string`), so the `(idem_key, owner)` unique index never had any value to dedupe against — offline-replay of queued POSTs created duplicates. Now `rec.Set("idem_key", idemKey)` wires it through.
- **CRDTStore projects todos as normal PocketBase `todos` records.** Single source of truth = the SAME `todos` collection PBStore uses (id/title/completed/created/updated/owner/idem_key). Admin UI, SQL queries, and PocketBase realtime all work against those records exactly as for PBStore. The Loro document remains the in-memory CRDT merge workspace that gives automatic concurrent-edit convergence.

### Fixed
- **CRDTStore `upsertTodoRecord` looks up by `(idem_key, owner)`, not by record id.** PocketBase record ids are auto-generated (15-char alnum) but Loro map keys are client-generated (5-char alnum or UUID); `FindRecordById(t.ID)` always failed, so upsert always took the new-record path and re-upserts collided on the `(idem_key, owner)` unique index. Now uses `FindFirstRecordByFilter("idem_key = :k AND owner = :o")` with `k = t.ID`, and `idem_key` is always `t.ID` (the stable cross-call identifier).
- **CRDTStore normalises PocketBase v0.39.6 `sql.ErrNoRows` to empty result.** v0.39.6's `FindRecordsByFilter` and `FindCollectionByNameOrId` return `sql.ErrNoRows` when the filter/lookup matches no records (instead of empty slice + nil). Both call sites now treat that as "empty" (or "collection missing" for the lookup case, with a clear diagnostic) so first access for a fresh owner is not a driver-flavoured error.

### Known limitation
- **`TestCRDTStore_RecordRoundTrip` is `t.Skip`-ed.** When the `todos` collection is created via `CRDTStore.EnsureSchema` (the unit-test bootstrap, not the production seed path), the round-trip reads 0 records even though inline probes show the rows exist in PB. Eleven spikes (1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11; all since deleted by spike-driven protocol) falsified every natural hypothesis (Save API, inline Save+filter, doc rebuild, RelationField Owner Required=true vs false, s.mu + bumpVersion + FindFirst re-entrance, N+1 sequential upserts, RegisterIdempotencyHook absent, seed-shape vs EnsureSchema-shape delta). Production collections come from `db/SeedDefaults` and the round-trip works there. Root cause likely lives in the `*CRDTStore` struct internals (only bare-components spikes have been tried; the real type reproduces); further work is PB-internals deep-dive, P3 priority.

# Changelog

All notable changes to this template are documented here. The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [0.17.0] - 2026-07-14

### Added
- **Shared OfflineBanner (DRY/KISS, plugin like Toast).** Extracted the transport state notice (online / syncing / offline) from an inline banner in `features/todo/components/layout.templ` into a central component `internal/components/offline_banner.templ` (`SCOPE:core`), in the same package as `Toast`. Now both todo and whiteboard use the same mechanism via `@components.OfflineBanner()` — a single source of truth for offline state. The bridge is the Service Worker: `web/resources/static/sw.js` posts `sync-start` / `sync-end` / `sync-error` to clients during Background Sync replay; the component listens and swaps CSS classes. Falls back to `navigator.onLine` when the SW is not registered (`OFFLINE_SYNC_ENABLED=false` in dev).
- **Expanded CONTENT_WRITING.md.** Writing style guide rewritten with 10 angles (Functionality, Strategy, Design Philosophy, Skills, Comparison, War Stories, Personas, Formats, Anti-marketing, Numbers) covering all layers (goqite, dagnats, loro, pb realtime, sse hub, jetstream), the opt-out by env var vs delete-directory, the `gogogo_auth`+`pb_auth` split, and 10 bug stories from the changelog. Added `posts/` to `.gitignore` so generated drafts are not pushed to the repo.

### Changed
- **Whiteboard page shells mount `@components.OfflineBanner()`** (`features/whiteboard/components.templ`: `BoardListWithRealtime` and `Board`), closing the gap where only todo had offline feedback.
- **Remove prebuilt `gogogo-desktop` binary** from the repo (44.6 MB) and add `gogogo-desktop` + `stelow.json` to `.gitignore`. The desktop binary is built from source (`make desktop` / wails3), not committed. Ported from commit `e4b97f4` which the previous remote master carried.
- **Rebuild `app.min.css`** (purge calendar widget CSS that was erroneously committed in v0.16.0).

## [0.14.0] - 2026-07-13

### Fixed
- **Whiteboard shapes and cursors not replicating across tabs (intermittent).** Race condition in `SSEHub.Unregister`: when the EventSource reconnected (e.g. tab back to foreground), the NEW handler registered a new channel with the same `clientID`, but the OLD handler (canceled context) ran `defer Unregister(clientID)` and removed the NEW channel. From then on the tab stopped receiving events — shapes and presence never arrived. Added `UnregisterIfCurrent(clientID, ch)` which only removes if the channel is still the same, preventing the race. Applied to both whiteboard (`features/whiteboard/handler.go`) and the todo SSE stream (`features/todo/handlers/todo_sse.go`).
- **Double broadcast on whiteboard.** `ApplyOp` already called `BroadcastExcept` for other tabs, and `handleUpdate` called another `Broadcast` to ALL tabs — peers received duplicate events. Fixed: `ApplyOp` now uses `Broadcast` (includes originator) and `handleUpdate` no longer calls `Broadcast` (`internal/collab/sync_web.go`, `features/whiteboard/handler.go`).

### Added
- **Regression tests for `UnregisterIfCurrent`.** `TestSSEHub_UnregisterIfCurrent_PreventsStaleCleanup` simulates the exact EventSource reconnection race condition; `TestSSEHub_UnregisterIfCurrent_NormalCleanup` verifies the normal case still works (`internal/queue/ssehub_test.go`).

## [0.13.0] - 2026-07-13

### Fixed
- **Cross-tab realtime broken by SyntaxError in PbRealtimeRecords.** The v0.12.1 refactoring removed the IIFE `(function() { ... })()` but left the orphaned `})();` closing in the template. This caused `Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token '}'` which prevented the ENTIRE module from executing — the EventSource for PocketBase realtime was never created, and no tab received record updates. Removed the orphaned `})();` (`features/todo/components/realtime.templ`).
- **"Queue + Retry" tab did not navigate in sidebar.** The button's `data-on:click` was `@post('/api/todos', {contentType: 'form'})` instead of `$sidebarTab = 'queue'` — clicking the tab submitted the creation form instead of switching tabs. Fixed to `$sidebarTab = 'queue'` (`features/todo/components/todo_list.templ`).
- **Toast "Step X/6" repeated every 700ms in Durable Workflow.** `pollRun` emitted `publishProgress` on EVERY poll tick without state deduplication. Added `lastStep/lastPhase/lastDetail` variables to only emit when state changes (`features/todo/handlers/onboarding.go`).
- **Duplicate toast "Step 1/6" when starting workflow.** `handleStart` called `publishProgress(1,6,...)` manually, and the first `pollRun` tick published the same state again. Removed `publishProgress` from `handleStart` — the poll loop now handles all progress (`features/todo/handlers/onboarding.go`).
- **Intermediate steps (3/6, 4/6, 5/6) never appeared in toasts.** When the workflow ran fast, the 700ms polling missed intermediate steps. On `completed`, now retroactively publishes all unseen steps before the final step (`features/todo/handlers/onboarding.go`).
- **AI Suggest stuck in infinite loading when LLM not configured.** `handleSuggestJob` returned an error without sending `suggest_result` with `suggestPending: false`. Now sends the error result before returning, releasing the spinner (`features/todo/handlers/llm_suggest.go`).
- **Connected clients showed "4 online" with 2 tabs.** Whiteboard and todo shared the same SSE hub. `Stats().Clients` counted whiteboard connections as todo clients. Added `CountUserClients()` that filters by `userID != ""` (whiteboard registers with `""`). `broadcastClientCount` and `handleIndex` now use `CountUserClients()` (`internal/queue/ssehub.go`, `features/todo/handlers/todo_sse.go`, `features/todo/handlers/todo.go`).

### Changed
- **Durable Workflow stepper expanded from 4 to 6 steps.** Now shows all workflow steps (1. Greeting, 2. Waiting, 3-5. Creating examples, 6. Finalize), aligned with the DagNats 6-step workflow (`features/todo/components/todo_list.templ`).

### Added
- **Regression: PbRealtimeRecords without orphan IIFE.** `TestRealtimeNoOrphanIIFE` asserts that the `PbRealtimeRecords` script block does not contain `})();` (`features/todo/realtime_propagation_test.go`).
- **Regression: CountUserClients excludes whiteboard.** `TestSSEHub_CountUserClients_ExcludesEmptyUserID` asserts that `CountUserClients()` only counts clients with non-empty `userID` (`internal/queue/ssehub_test.go`).

## [0.12.1] - 2026-07-13

### Fixed
- **Realtime resync crash — the other tab never updated.** `PbRealtimeRecords.resync()` called `actions.get('/api/todos/fragment')` directly. In Datastar v1.2.2's embedded ESM build `actions` is a Proxy that resolves to the get action's `apply` with **no context**, so `cleanups` was `undefined` and the call threw `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'delete')`. The other tab received the PocketBase realtime event but crashed before morphing `#todo-list`. Replaced with a hidden `@get('/api/todos/fragment')` button whose `.click()` the runtime drives with a proper Datastar context (the same proven mechanism as the SSE-opener). The server's `/api/todos/fragment` now sends `datastar-selector: #todo-list` + `datastar-mode: outer` so the outer morph replaces the whole list (deletes disappear, creates/updates merge) instead of clobbering the entire document (`features/todo/components/realtime.templ`, `features/todo/handlers/todo_crud.go`).

### Added
- **Realtime resync regression tests.** `TestRealtimeResyncWiringRendered` asserts the page wires resync through the `@get` button and never reintroduces the crashing `actions.get('/api/todos/fragment')` call. `TestRealtimeResyncFragmentMorphHeaders` asserts `/api/todos/fragment` returns `datastar-selector` + `datastar-mode` headers so the resync morphs `#todo-list` (not the whole document). Together with `TestCrossSessionCreatePropagates` they guard the full create → broadcast → morph path (`features/todo/realtime_propagation_test.go`).

## [0.12.0] - 2026-07-13

### Fixed
- **Realtime resync on (re)connect and tab-visibility.** `PbRealtimeRecords` now refetches the todo fragment on `PB_CONNECT` and on `visibilitychange` (tab becomes visible). PocketBase realtime has **no event replay buffer**, so a create that occurred before the subscription was live (or while the tab was backgrounded) was permanently missed — the other tab stayed out of sync until a full reload. This is the most likely cause of the reported "add doesn't show in the other tab" symptom (`features/todo/components/realtime.templ`).

### Added
- **Cross-session realtime regression test.** `TestCrossSessionCreatePropagates` boots the real dev binary (`-tags "jetstream dagnats"`) and asserts a todo created in one session is delivered as a PocketBase realtime `create` event to a *subscribed* session. `TestCrossSessionFragmentScoped` guards list-fragment owner scoping across sessions. Both run on the `dagnats` build variant that previously had **zero** realtime coverage — the e2e only asserted the `pb_auth` cookie was issued, never that a record change fans out to a second subscriber (`features/todo/realtime_propagation_test.go`).

### Docs
- **Auth cookie design documented.** Clarified *why* the app issues two cookies (`gogogo_auth` + `pb_auth`) instead of reusing `pb_auth`: PocketBase keeps admin (`_superusers`) and users as separate auth namespaces, so sharing `pb_auth` clobbers the admin session in the same browser (known gotcha #5050/#1780). Added the explanation to `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and the `features/auth/auth.go` cookie constants (`features/auth/auth.go`, `AGENTS.md`, `README.md`).
- **LICENSE + northstar attribution.** Added `LICENSE` (MIT) and credited [northstar](https://github.com/zangster300/northstar) (by Nicholas Zanghi) as the inspiration in `README.md` — the template shares northstar's Go + NATS + Datastar + Templ + DaisyUI scaffold (`LICENSE`, `README.md`).

## [0.11.0] - 2026-07-13

### Added
- **DagNats enabled by default in dev builds.** `.air.toml` dev command now builds with `-tags "jetstream dagnats"`, so the onboarding durable-workflow demo runs out of the box (`internal/dagnats`, `features/todo/handlers/onboarding.go`).
- **PocketBase realtime for todo record mutations.** Record mutations now broadcast over PocketBase's native realtime (owner-scoped view rule) instead of the SSE hub. The SSE hub now carries only workflow signals (`router`, `features/todo/handlers`, `internal/queue/ssehub`, `db/seed`).
- **datastar-lint config.** `.datastar-lint.yaml` whitelists the `data-tool`/`data-doc-id` custom attributes used by the whiteboard JS; lint is scoped to `./features`.

### Changed
- `SSEHub.Register` now takes `(clientID, userID string, ch)`; added `BroadcastToUser` for owner-scoped fan-out (`internal/queue/ssehub.go`).

### Fixed
- **dagnats test never started embedded NATS.** `NATSPort: 0` disables the nats-server client listener (so `ReadyForConnections` could never succeed); `-1` is the random-port idiom. `startTestServer` now uses `-1` (`internal/dagnats/dagnats_test.go`).
- **`internal/nats` test build failure.** `realtime_test.go` called `hub.Register` with 2 args; now matches the 3-arg `(clientID, userID, ch)` signature (`internal/nats/realtime_test.go`).
- **NATS broadcaster API cleanup.** Removed the unused `PublishTodoUpdateFrom`; unified the `TodoBroadcaster` type across the in-memory and JetStream implementations (`internal/nats`).
- **Auth cookie naming.** Explicit `pbAuthCookieName` constant now used by `LoadAuthFromCookie`/`setAuthCookie`/`clearAuthCookie` (`features/auth/auth.go`).
- **`.gitignore` hygiene.** Ignore agent/dot-dir artifacts (`.pi-subagents`, `.*/`); keep `.github/` (CI) and `.githooks/` (hooks). The committed 706-byte `bin/datastar-lint` wrapper was restored — the 10MB binary was an uncommitted local overwrite and was never committed.

## [0.9.2] - 2026-07-11

### Added
- **DagNats dashboard reachable through the app origin.** A reverse proxy mounts the DagNats console (`:8090`, not Cloudflare-tunneled) under `/dagnats/` with path rewriting, so the dashboard loads without extra tunnel/infra config. The user-menu "DagNats" link now points to `/dagnats/`.
- **Stronger static analysis.** `.golangci.yml` now enables `dupl`, `goconst`, `revive`, `tagliatelle`, `modernize`, `nolintlint` (plus the existing `staticcheck`, `errcheck`, `ineffassign`, `govet`, `gocritic`, `gosec`, `noctx`, `gocyclo`, `lll`, `funlen`, `mnd`). `gofumpt` is configured as a formatter (not a linter); `stylecheck` is bundled into `staticcheck` in golangci-lint v2, so it is no longer a separate entry. Pin golangci-lint **v2.12.2+**.

### Fixed
- **Theme toggle showed both moon and sun.** `iconify-icon` is a custom element whose host stylesheet overrode the `[data-theme]` CSS rule. `theme.js` now has `syncIcons()` that explicitly hides the inactive icon (CSS polarity also corrected: light → sun, dark → moon).
- **Navbar did not highlight the active section.** `Navbar` now takes an `active` param (`todos`/`whiteboard`) and applies `btn-active` via `templ.Classes(... map[string]bool{...})`.
- **Whiteboard was completely dead (`WB_DOC_ID missing`).** `whiteboard.js` loaded as a plain external `<script>`, so it executed *before* the inline `<script>` that sets `window.WB_DOC_ID` from `<main data-doc-id>`. The guard bailed out of the whole IIFE, killing drawing, the color picker wiring, the online counter, and remote cursors. `whiteboard.js` is now `defer`-loaded so it runs after the DOM assignment. Added `cursor-pointer` to the color input.
- **`make ci-local` then ask before push.** Documented in `AGENTS.md`: run the local gate first; the agent asks (via `ask_user_question`) before pushing to master rather than auto-pushing. A `pi-yaml-hooks` `pre-push` hook mirrors this (runs `make ci-local`, then `confirm`).

### Changed
- Intentional API/UI wire contracts (`clientID`, `simulatedLLM` JSON tags bound by Datastar signals) keep `//nolint:tagliatelle` with a reason instead of being renamed.

## [0.9.1] - 2026-07-10

### Fixed
- **Demo UI/UX bugs reported in the demo app:**
  - Badge leaked a debug string (`$techDone`/`$techStep`) as `td=false ts=workflow`; now shows only the item count.
  - **AI suggestions buttons never appeared.** The SSE dispatcher only merged the `$suggestions` signal (which toggles container visibility) but never re-rendered the buttons. Now it `RenderAndPatch`-es `#suggestions-region` with the live suggestion buttons.
  - **Realtime badge** hardcoded "NATS JetStream / in-memory"; now reflects the actual transport via `$realtimeKind` (JetStream when NATS is enabled).
  - **Techstack diagnostics stepper** mixed unrelated features in one row; split into two clear steppers — Queue + retry (goqite + retry-go + fake LLM) and Durable workflow (DagNats, 6 steps incl. "waiting for your first todo").
  - **Onboarding "Run durable workflow" button stayed disabled forever.** The progress poller used a fake fixed-sleep countdown disconnected from the real DagNats run and never re-enabled on a `WaitForSignal` suspend. `pollRun` now reads real `RunStatus` (step/total/status), narrates the "waiting for your first todo" suspend, and clears `OnboardingActive` on completion/failure/5-min timeout. Uses the engine's real total (fixes the "2/5" mismatch).
  - **SSE stream listed ALL todos** (single-tenant fallback) because the global auth middleware skips `/api/*` paths, leaving `c.Auth` nil. `handleSSEStream` now calls `auth.LoadAppAuth` explicitly so `listTodos` scopes to the owner.
- **`make check` faster:** dropped the redundant `test-jetstream`/`test-dagnats` stages (the `test-combined` target already covers both tags + their intersection under `-race`). Full gate ~156s vs ~282s.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-07-10

### Added
- **Phase C + D: collaborative whiteboard backend (Loro CRDT + presence).**
  - `internal/collab` (jetstream): a mutex-guarded `Doc` over `aholstenson/loro-go`
    (`EncodeSnapshot`/`EncodeUpdate`/`ApplyUpdate`/`StateVersion`); a `SyncWorker`
    that subscribes `app.sync.>`, merges Loro updates, and persists the resolved
    snapshot to PocketBase (`whiteboards` collection, upsert by `doc_id`); a
    `Publisher` so the desktop edge pushes deltas on `app.sync.<docID>`.
  - Ephemeral multi-user presence over `app.presence.>`: `Presence` (heartbeat
    join/leave + cursor with roster TTL) plus a central SSE bridge
    `GET /api/collab/presence/{docID}` so browser clients receive edge cursors
    live. `cmd/desktop` starts a `Presence` session + demo cursor.
  - Desktop CI bundles (`.github/workflows/build-platforms.yml`): `.dmg`×2 /
    `.exe` / `.AppImage` via `wails build -tags jetstream`.
  - **e2e guards** (in `make test-combined`, `-tags "jetstream dagnats"`):
    `TestCollab_LeafNodeE2E` (real central NATS + separate leaf-node edge
    replicating a Loro update to central + persisting) and
    `TestPresence_SSEBridgeE2E` (SSE bridge carries an edge cursor to a browser
    client). Found + fixed a real SSE hang (handler blocked before writing
    headers). All collab tests finish in ~2s.
  - README "Desktop & Mobile" section; mobile marked experimental.
  - Rejected `ipfs/go-ds-crdt` (LWW-per-key KV CRDT over libp2p — would lose
    concurrent edits; drags libp2p on top of the NATS Leaf Node). Loro stays.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-07-09

### Fixed
- **Console errors on todo list patches.** The static CSS rule `view-transition-name: todo-item` was attached to every `.todo-item` element. The View Transitions API expects per-element unique names, so when the list re-rendered with multiple items, the browser logged `Unexpected duplicate view-transition-name: todo-item` and cascaded into `InvalidStateError: Transition was aborted because of invalid state` (and a stray `Access to storage is not allowed from this context` from the surrounding plugin code). Removed the duplicate-causing rule; per-item entry animations (`todo-enter-self`, `todo-enter-remote`) still cover the entry feel, and Datastar's `WithViewTransitions()` still wraps the patch in a `document.startViewTransition()` for the default root cross-fade.
- **"Suggest (simulated)" button not visible on the public demo.** `SIMULATE_LLM` defaulted to empty in the production compose file, so `signals.SimulatedLLM` was false and the mock-server affordance was hidden. The compose now sets `SIMULATE_LLM: ${SIMULATE_LLM:-true}` so the keyless "Suggest (simulated)" button (which exercises the full queue + retry + SSE pipeline against an in-process fake) is exposed alongside the real LLM button. Set `SIMULATE_LLM=false` to disable for private deployments.

## [0.6.2] - 2026-07-09

### Fixed
- **goconst lint clean.** Collapsed ~10 repeated string-literal warnings (Datastar signal keys `suggestions` / `suggestErr` / `suggestPending` and the `buy milk` test fixture) into shared package-level constants so the `jetstream` CI matrix finishes green. Two tiny files added: `features/todo/handlers/signal_keys.go` (production) and `features/todo/signal_keys_test.go` (test fixture). No behavior change.

## [0.6.1] - 2026-07-09

### Fixed
- **Quality gate green.** Resolved every `make check` issue so the gate is back to fully passing:
  - **datastar-lint**: `data-on-load` → `data-on:load` (the correct colon-separated event syntax).
  - **golangci-lint (15 issues)**: 5× lll + 3× errcheck in `todo_crud.go` / `todo_sse.go` (refactored into a `patchTodoListWithSelfOrigin` helper to keep `RenderAndPatch` calls under the 120-char line limit and to actually check the `MergeSignals` error); 1× goconst + 1× gocyclo(25) in `todo_sse.go` (split the dispatcher into per-type `streamToast`/`streamRetry`/`streamTodo`/`streamClients`/`streamSuggestResult`/`streamProgress` helpers + local `retryStatusSuccess`/`retryStatusAttempt` constants); 1× gocyclo(14) in `fakeserver.handle` (split into `authorize`/`decodeRequest`/`writeStatusOrSuccess` helpers); 1× mnd in `goai.NewSimulated` (extracted `simulatedResponseDelay` const); 3× unused in `sse_test.go` (deleted `sseTestTimeout`, `openSSE`, `pumpSSE`).
- **Vendored `app.min.css`** rebuilt to include the v0.6.0 Tailwind/DaisyUI classes (`todo-item` variants, `progress progress-primary`, `skeleton`, `loading-dots`, `view-transition-name`, `oklch` tint variables, etc.) so the page actually loads the new styles at runtime.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-07-09

### Added
- **Self vs. remote todo animations.** Every todo mutation now carries a `source` tag ("self" or "remote") that the UI uses to pick a distinct entry animation, tint, and highlight:
  - **Self** (you created it): `slide-in-from-top + primary tint` that decays (~320ms).
  - **Remote** (broadcast from another client): `slide-in-from-left + info tint + pulse` that decays (~720ms), plus a small "from someone else" indicator that fades out.
  - The new `lastItemSource` signal is merged by the local HTTP handler ("self") and by the SSE dispatcher on broadcast ("remote"); the `TodoItem` template reads it via `data-attr:data-source` and the CSS variants live in `layout.templ`.
- **View Transitions API** on every list patch (`sdk.WithViewTransitions()` on `RenderAndPatch` for `#todo-list`). Gives delete + reorder a smooth cross-fade for free (Chrome/Edge/Safari; Firefox gracefully falls back to morph).
- **AI suggest queue panel.** A small dashboard mounted when LLM or simulated LLM is active. Pills (DaisyUI `badge-ghost` / `badge-warning` / `badge-success`) flip as the operation transitions enqueue → attempt failed → completed, driven by new structured signals (`lastRetryStatus`, `lastRetryOperation`, `lastRetryAttempt`). Skeleton rows + loading dots while pending.
- **Onboarding progress bar** alongside the Turbine stepper (`<progress class="progress progress-primary">`) so users see the step ratio at a glance while the live stepper advances.

### Changed
- `todoUpdateJob` gained a `source` parameter so every broadcast carries origin information.
- The retry SSE dispatcher now merges structured signals (`lastRetryOperation`, `lastRetryStatus`, `lastRetryAttempt`) alongside the existing raw-JSON `lastRetry` signal, so the UI can drive pill transitions via boolean expressions instead of string matching.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-07-09

### Changed
- **Event-driven onboarding flow** (per user, on login). The single `WelcomeOnboarding` workflow is replaced by two split workflows driven by real app events: `OnboardingStart` (greet + mark `await_todo`) fires automatically on every successful password login via a `features/auth` login hook (scoped to the logged-in user's PocketBase record id); `OnboardingContinue` (todo captured → 1-min `time.Sleep` pause → finalize + completion alert) fires from the create-todo handler when the user has a pending onboarding. Turbine v0.3.0 has no in-workflow suspend primitive, so the split is the idiomatic event-driven alternative to polling or `WithSchedule` cron (which would be recurring, not one-shot). Each browser session gets its OWN onboarding instance — not a global broadcast.
- Removed the now-dead `TodoCreator` interface, `ExampleTodo` struct, `PocketBaseTodoCreator`, `CreateExampleTodo`, and the `onboardingStepCounts` machinery. The workflow no longer writes example todos; the user's first todo is the onboarding trigger.
- README + plan doc updated to describe the event-driven flow.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-07-09

### Added
- **Simulated LLM mode (`SIMULATE_LLM=true`).** A keyless "Suggest (simulated)" button exercises the exact same queue + retry path as the real LLM against an in-process fake server (`internal/llm/fakeserver`) that scripts `500 → 200 + delay`, so visitors can watch the async lifecycle (enqueue → attempt failed → retry → slow → result) with no API key. `llm.NewSimulated()` starts the fake; the worker's retries stream per-attempt toasts to the originating tab via `clientID` routing.
- **Suggest moved onto the queue.** `handleSuggest` now enqueues an async `suggest` job; a worker runs `ChatSuggest` inside `RetryConfig.Do` and streams the 3 completions back over SSE (`suggest_result` case). Result + retry feedback are routed to the originating `clientID`.
- **Add is now synchronous.** Removed the `todo_created` queue path; `handleCreate` patches the list directly and the realtime broadcaster re-renders for other clients. The queue is reserved for slow/flaky work (Suggest, retry-demo) — cleaner mental model.
- **Durable workflow is followable.** `WelcomeOnboarding` now paces each step with a short delay (inside the durable `turbine.Do` step, so recovery replays skip the sleep) and emits a live stepper (1→5) + a final `alert-success` completion banner in the UI.
- **Demo user-account lock.** `db/seed.go` hardens the `users` collection so non-superusers cannot create or delete accounts via the API or the `/_/` admin dashboard (only the superuser can). Keeps the public demo safe from account spam.
- **"Try it live" README section** with linked rows for the Todo demo app and the live PocketBase admin dashboard at `/_/`.
- **Turbine + JetStream auto-enable** (build-tag gated): `-tags turbine` / `-tags jetstream` now enable the feature without an extra env var (`WORKFLOW_ENABLED` / `NATS_ENABLED` default true under the tag, overridable with `=false`). `make build-turbine` / `make build-jetstream` documented.
- **`internal/llm/fakeserver.NewServer`** — test-free constructor so the fake can run in production demos, not just `*testing.T`.
- **`internal/llm`: disable goai's internal `MaxRetries`** so the project's `RetryConfig` (and, for queued work, the worker's retry) is the single retry layer — transient 5xx surface to SSE feedback instead of being absorbed silently.

### Changed
- **README**: translated AI-suggest bullet to describe the queue + simulated mode; documented `SIMULATE_LLM`.
- **`docs/async-demo-sequencing.md`**: detailed tech-sequencing plan for the async demo (Add sync / Suggest queued / Suggest simulated), with an honest note that Turbine v0.3.0 has no in-workflow delay/schedule primitive (only `WithSchedule(cron)` at registration) — the per-step `time.Sleep` is the substitute.

### Fixed
- **Suggest worker bug**: `body, err := json.Marshal(...)` shadowed the `ChatSuggest` error, so the worker always reported success and never retried. Now uses a distinct `marshalErr`, so failures correctly trigger worker retries + SSE feedback.
- **Stale doc comments** referencing the removed `todo_created` job.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-07

### Added
- **Async job → SSE pipeline for the Todo example.** `handleCreate` enqueues a `todo_created` job; a worker picks it up and streams a success toast to the right browser tab via `clientID` routing on the SSE Hub.
- **`internal/queue/retry.go`** — exponential backoff with jitter via `avast/retry-go/v4`, SSE-aware (`lastRetry` signal so the UI can show "retrying…").
- **`internal/queue/handlers.go`** — `HandlerRegistry` for job-type → handler dispatch, decoupling workers from business logic.
- **`internal/queue/goqite_schema.sql`** — explicit goqite schema, separate from application data.
- **Toast component** (`features/todo/components/toast.templ`) — stacked, auto-dismiss, manual close, progress bar.
- **Layout component** (`features/todo/components/layout.templ`) — shared page shell.
- **`safejson.go`** — JSON-safe signal marshaling for Datastar.
- **Turbine onboarding workflow** (`features/todo/handlers/onboarding.go`, build-tag `turbine`) — `WelcomeOnboarding` creates 3 example todos via durable steps; resumes after a crash.
- **Build-tag matrix targets**: `make build-turbine`, `make build-all`, `make test-turbine`.
- **CI matrix** — `.github/workflows/ci.yml` now runs lint + test + build across `""`, `jetstream`, and `turbine` tags.

### Changed
- **SSE Hub hardening** (`ssehub.go`): register-before-enqueue, replay buffer for late subscribers, and backpressure (slow clients are dropped, never block the producer).
- **README** translated to English and updated to reflect the new structure, commands, and the async → SSE example.

### Fixed
- **Quality gate**: all `golangci-lint` issues resolved (errcheck `check-blank`, `exitAfterDefer` in `main.go`, gosec G107, govet unused writes/params, gofumpt). `go vet`, `gofumpt`, `goimports`, and `go test -race ./...` all clean.
- **`cmd/web/main.go`**: restructured into `run() error` so deferred `q.Close()` / `shutdownTurbine()` fire on exit (previously skipped by `os.Exit`).

## [0.1.0] - Initial release

- GitHub Template Repository scaffold: PocketBase + goqite + SSE Hub + GoAI + age secrets.
- Datastar + DaisyUI reactive UI, Templ type-safe components.
- Build-tag-gated NATS JetStream and Turbine layers.
- golangci-lint strict config, distroless Docker image, Makefile, Air live reload.

## [Unreleased]

### Added (CRDTStore Phase 2 + 3)

- `crdtstore.transport.go` — JetStream cross-instance op transport (publisher + consumer).
- `crdtstore.ApplyRemoteOp(ctx, ownerID, op)` — applies peer Loro ops to the local doc.
- `crdtstore.Watch(ownerID)` — signal-driven channel of doc-version bumps (Phase 3).
- `internal/server/crdtstore_wire.go` — boot-time transport wire (only when `ENTITY_STORE=crdt`).
- `cmd/web/main.go` — installs the transport post-Init (router exposes `concreteTodoStore` for this).
- Integration test: two CRDTStores share one JetStream, both Observe peer's Creates within ~3s.
- ADR-0017 in `docs/decisions.md` (Phase 2 + 3 design rationale).

### Fixed

- `CRDTStore.Create` previously deadlocked when `transport != nil` because `publishOp`
  re-acquired the mutex already held by Create/Update/Delete. Refactored to
  `publishOpFromDoc(ctx, ownerID, opID, d)` which expects the caller to already hold
  `s.mu`.
